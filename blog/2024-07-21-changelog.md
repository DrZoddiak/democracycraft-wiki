# Welcome
Welcome back and welcome in to this weeks release of the rolling Changelog. We are a week behind in getting this posted but are excited to getting it published for you all to view!

# Features
- Bedrock users are now able to create chestshops!
- Elixir Side Effects
  - When logging out after excessively consuming Elixirs the user may experience slow or grogginess upon logging back into the server. This is a side effect of the Elixir consumption.
  - The side effect has been lowered from a **7** day duration to a **2** day duration.
- Application Sync to forums and discord! The creation of #applications channel within each department discord now allows departments to see  applications without having to go on the forums everyday!

:::note
We have been working on this feature for **6** months. It started out as an idea, utilizing Google forms and then transitioning to webhooks. These ideas are what keep  DemocracyCraft current and up to date!

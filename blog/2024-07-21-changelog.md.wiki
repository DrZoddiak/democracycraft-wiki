* Bedrock users are now able to create chestshops!
* Elixir Side Effects
** When logging out after excessively consuming Elixirs the user may experience slow or grogginess upon logging back into the server. This is a side effect of the Elixir consumption.
** The side effect has been lowered from a '''7''' day duration to a '''2''' day duration.
* Application Sync to forums and discord! The creation of #applications channel within each department discord now allows departments to see applications without having to go on the forums everyday!

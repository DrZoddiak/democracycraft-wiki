# Hello!
Welcome to the first blog write-up on the Staff Feedback Survey! This is a tool we use within the Staff team to assess how we're doing internally, both as a team and individually. Usually each month a survey is run, and results collected, anonymised then published for the team to see. The last time the survey was run was back in Marhc, between my absense and compounding duties unfortunately this function was neglected.

Moving forward however, we still intend to resume this function being a monthly endeavour. :)

## Respondants

We had a great turnout this time, of **21** respondants! This is brilliant news, as even I can't recall this level of participation in a long time. This represents roughly ~90% of the Staff team having participated in the survey...

:::tip Your responses are anonymised!

As you'll find below, no individual response is disected and where there is identifiable information - it is removed. Private concerns between Staff are also raised privately with as much of the response obscured. Where it is too evident who said what, we refrain from using their language/response directly and reword it.

We value your input, and strive to act accordingly.

## The Ratings

Let's break it down by question!

### How do you feel the Staff Team is going as a whole?

- **45%** of you voted an 8!
  - Double the amount of respondants rated this compared to March! Amazing!
- **20%** of you voted a 9!
- **15%** of you voted a 10!
- **5%** of you voted a 4!

:::tip
**76%** of you rate the team an A.
:::

### How valued do you feel as a Staff Member?

- **37%** of you voted a 9!
- **32%** of you voted an 8!
- **26%** of you voted a 10!
- **5%** of you voted a 1!

:::tip
**85%** of you feel that you are appreciated at an A standard!
:::

### How approachable are Senior Staff with issues impacting me and/or the server?

- **45%** of you voted a 10!
- **20%** of you voted a 7!
- **15%** of you voted a 9!
- **5%** of you voted a 1 and 6 respectively!

:::warning
**66%** of you feel that senior leadership are approachable to issues affecting you/the server!
- While we've observed a fairly high portion rate ``10``, there's evidently variance in how approachable we are to you all.
- More thought needs to be given from senior leadership as a result to seeing how we can make ourselves more approachable to **everyone equally.**
:::

### Do you feel like you can raise issues with Senior Staff without negatively impacting your staff career?

- **35%** of you voted a 10!
- **25%** of you voted an 8!
- **20%** of you voted a 9!
- **10%** of you voted a 7!
- **5%** of you voted 6 and 1!

:::warning
**77%** of you feel that you can raise issues to senior leadership without having it negatively affect your Staffing career. 
- While again, a high portion of ``10`` respondants are observed, we're still concerned about the spread of responses.
- This is a more interesting issue, as in order to identify how we can improve we need to identify cases where it outcomes from reporting issues **appear** to negatively impact Staff.
  - Notice the emphasis on appear, it's not simply enough for us to say we've never negatively retaliated against a report. Simply the perception alone is something we need to work on eliminating, and identifying where it occurs will be our first step in that process.
:::

## The 5%
I will start by saying the reoccuring 5% is an utter failure and reflects on senior leadership. I will be taking responsibility on this given I've been running the ship in End's absense, I am not disappointed at the respondants (I don't know who they are anyway) but disappointed that this wasn't detected earlier.

The 5%, albeit it small and statistical outliers demonstrate there is a spread in treatment and perception of one's duties that is **unacceptable**. This is the last thing we want to see as senior leadership because team cohension and equality matters in promoting a healthy and engaging team.

The feedback provided by these respondants however has been invaluable, and appreciated, as their responses tended to be succint yet detailed. I'm positive and look forward with a sense of optimism to eliminating this margin (by improving scores, not killing!!!) now that I know where to start improving.

## Hardest Working...

A warm congratulations to ``JediAJMan`` for making **hardest working Moderator**, with 26% of respondants!
- There was a three-way tie for second, and two way for third!

A warm congratulations to **Adam_The_Warrior** for making **hardest working Administrator**, with a shocking **55%** of respondants!
- I believe this is the largest margin I've ever seen. Wow!

## The Senior Leadership Team
The exciting stuff, what you've said about us!

### Tech (me :o)

#### What going well
- Activity
- Work on the server backend
- Expressive/has fun
- Staff expansion and fostering a feeling of community

#### Areas to be improved
1. Working on fixing things instead of adding new things. 
2. Getting feedback before implementing new features.
3. Testing before implementation.
4. List of plugins and whether they are reloadable.
5. Make sure Administrators check with System Administrators before implementing changes.
6. Professionalism/less shit talking

#### My Response
I'm deeply touched for what is overly positive feedback! It's always exciting to see what is said about me, but also the areas I can improve. I've numbered areas of improvement so I can get straight into addressing them. :) 
- Fixing things is my uttermost priority, always. It pains me a little that there is the perception of me solely focusing on adding new features, but I've come to see why that might be the perception. 
  - I highly encourage reading this blog post [here](https://wiki.democracycraft.net/blog/2024-07-25-how-tech-works/) that I made to address the concern. 
  - In short, bug fixes first always - but I do them quite silently which means it can often go unnoticed. I add features when I have spare time. :)
- I also test plugins before implementation always, that's a no-brainer to me. I can see why it might feel otherwise, but *all* the bugs in new plugins I introduce are unanticipated. It is expected there are issues with change, I try to catch all of them by asking myself "how could a player break this", but at the end of the day I make peace with the fact I'll never catch em all! (Sorry Ash...)
  - If you feel there were instances of issues that could have been avoided through testing - feel free to let me know! If you're not comfortable telling me directly, feel free to use our anonymous feedback option [here](https://www.democracycraft.net/forums/report/). 
- List of plugins done! You can view them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12P4_rVIWwyrq4ney6FU0dm2sKoLRLXN-S6oI-LOXrB8/).
- The current system has it so Administrators make changes that are logged for System Administrators to review - if there's any confusion on that, I'm happy to discuss it more with you or have it raised in the anonymous feedback section!
- Yeah I do need to be more professional haha, I sometimes do vent a bit too far to decompress - I'll work on reigning it in. :)

### End (my other half)
#### What's going well
- "Good" (sorry, you guys used that word a lot! So yes, good!)
- Engagement with all aspects of the server

#### Areas to be improved
- Activity/engagement with the community
- Communication

##### Response
I've discussed activity with End and he's mentioned it in Staff - unfortunately between work commitments and burnout End has been less active than he would like. We however discuss (almost daily!) server operations and Staffing, and in recent days you might have noticed End is trying to appear online and work with the community directly. We all miss the silly Kangaroo.

### Berry (the bingus)
#### What's going well
- Having fun
- Knowledgable
#### Areas to be improved on
- Activity

##### Response 
Bingus has received less feedback compared to End and I, so it's hard to directly touch on issues. Given her Managerial role, it's expected she's been taking a more advisory role to Senior Administrators and us Owners. She's definitely aware of her drop in activity, and I'm sure that will be improved upon!

### Nacho (the whale)
#### What's going well
- Activity
- "Everything" (wowzers!)
- Good (same as End!)

#### Areas to be improved on
- Giving grace/communication

##### Response
I've first hand seen Nacho progress over the months, picking up a lot of technical experience but also life/people skills. He's aware that he comes off a bit harsh, sometimes unintentionally - but it's something that's been worked on and continues to be. I'm sure he's also quite humbled and thrilled to see that there was an overwhelmingly positive volume of feedback for the Chip!


## The ✨ Staffing Experience ✨
Nearly done haha! I think for this section I'll just summarise feedback and write out my thoughts.

- Culture is described quite loosely among the team as a whole, described as chaotic/balanced/nice and fun. Diversity is raised as a great feature of the team, with a general sentiment that people feel like they belong in the team. It was nice to read these comments. :)
  - Work needs to be done so everyone feels this sentiment however, some people feel disconnected with their peers or upper management.

- Opportunities are overwhelmingly described as positive, Staff seem quite excited for the future and appreciative of the pathways presented.
  - However, there's also a fair amount of respondants unsure of what pathways for progression exist.
  - To improve, we may need to directly chart values and what progression opportunities look like. This will take some time and consultation naturally!

- There is an overwhelming sense that **standards** need to be documented and enforced. A lot of Staff members feel punishments could be more consistent, and that expectations need to be equally enforced.
  - I strongly believe this comes down to these matters not being written down. Conflicts of Interest are brought up often, but no clear guidelines for it exists.
  - Punishments are encouraged to be discretionary but relative, a framework seems to be sought by Staff members so they know what punishments to issue relative to their peers.
- More hype and media focus on server features/release.
  - I agree strongly. I'm unsure how we'll get better on this, but it starts with us actively considering these things when releasing new features. We aim to have initiatives out hopefully before the next survey!
- Workload needs to be more evenly distributed, especially wtih Discord tickets. A sentiment shared throughout the team.
  - Tickets should not be denied on the basis they are opened on behalf of another player. I agree with this feedback, and personally am aware of only one instance of this occuring. This will not be the case moving forward - as we recognise not everyone has Discord. 
- Suggestions need to be better processed with Staff input.
  - Some Staff members suggest that we have members champion or vote on these suggestions. 
  - A framework definitely needs to be made to process suggestions. I used to do them myself, but I got burnt out.

- The Staff members that report having gotten feedback appreciate it a lot, but Staff members would like more feedback in general.

- Most of the ideas/miscellaneous comments have been addressed above, but there were a few situation-specific comments I cannot share for privacy reasons. All of them have been read, acknowledged, and actively getting addressed.

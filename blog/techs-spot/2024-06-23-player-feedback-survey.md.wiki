<span id="hello"></span>
= Hello =

Welcome to the first blog write-up on the Player Feedback Survey! We’ve ran the Player Feedback Survey every month since June 2020, but this is the first time we’re leveraging our new wiki to give you the full rundown on our findings, approval ratings, and thoughts. This is also the first time I’m writing long-form content for the server (excluding guides), so bare with me as I get my footing on the server’s now official blog!

<span id="ratings"></span>
== Ratings ==

Given these ratings were optional by nature, some of our playerbase chose not to provide a rating for some members - or complete them at all. Each Staff member got a message in their Discord Staff channel containing a breakdown of their numerical ratings (displayable as a bar graph).

Below are ratings broken down by department of the Staff team. :)

{{Info||| How are ratings classified and calculated? For the purposes of this post, we’ve grouped numerical ratings into five categories, Very Poor (<code>1</code>), Poor (<code>2</code>), Fair (<code>3</code>), Good (<code>4</code>), and Excellent (<code>5</code>).

The Percentage of Responses found below in each table is calculated by summing up all scores belonging to each respective category, then dividing it by the number of responses received for each respective category.}}

<span id="senior-administration"></span>
=== Senior Administration ===

These include the Owners, Manager, and Senior Administrators. We received 571 individual ratings for this category, which means ~82 responses per member.

<span id="general-feedback-raised"></span>
==== General Feedback Raised ====

* Players tended to provide a mix of hollistic and personal experience based responses.
** This makes sense, given this category is often referred to as server leadership as well, and contains our most senior positions.
* Feedback based on personal experience with senior administration were very positive, as players were pleased with community engagement from members of senior administration.
* Hollistic feedback however was more mixed.
** A lot of comments prefaced saying they like individuals in senior administration, but have concerns over how they conduct themselves in terms of the wider community.
** This often centres around participation in Government, and general behaviour with players.
** Most players recognised certain issues were inevitable (especially surrounding Government), and were unsure how to amend them. i.e. perceptions when involved in server politics.
* A high number of respondants report that activity has improved or is high among this category.

<span id="administration"></span>
=== Administration ===

This includes our Administrators. We received 392 individual ratings for this category, which means ~78 responses per member.

<span id="general-feedback-raised-1"></span>
==== General Feedback Raised ====

* There were several members of administration that were praised by name, a lot of love for the team overall.
** This is interesting given some members were mentioned to be inactive, but still overall highly rated due to their past and ongoing contributions to the server.
** Players seem to recognise that the role of Administrators are long-term one, and more behind the scenes than our moderation team.
* No administration-wide feedback unfortunately, most feedback given to this category hinges based on personal interaction.

<span id="moderation"></span>
=== Moderation ===

This includes our Moderators, and Trial Moderators. We received 641 individual ratings for this category, which means ~80 responses per member.

<span id="general-feedback-raised-2"></span>
==== General Feedback Raised ====

* A lot of feedback was given about specific members, with any overarching feedback based on how Staff deal with punishments and behaviour.
* Most feedback is concerned with activity, a lot of members that got poorly rated were inactive Staff members.
** Positive feedback on the other hand was focused on Staff availability and specific commendation of staff members.
* Inconsistency with punishments and unhospitable Staff are the most reoccuring complaints.

<span id="punishments"></span>
=== Punishments ===

This one was only covered in one question, that being “How do you feel the staff team handles '''punishments'''”, however I believe it deserves its own section in the blog due to how important of a task player moderation is.

<span id="breaking-down-the-responses-first"></span>
==== Breaking down the responses first ====

* '''47.87%''' of responses were eight and ten inclusive. (Excellent)
* '''39.36%''' of responses were between five and seven inclusive. (Fair)
* '''12.77%''' of responses were between one and three inclusive (Poor)

While '''~86% of responses''' were Fair and above, internally we’re hoping to raise Excellent responses to around '''~65%''', as it forms a large part of day-to-day Staffing, and robust punishment processes helps ensure everyone feels like they are being treated fairly and a part of a safe community.

Most complaints surrounding punishments are to do with equal application, or poor escalation, but interestingly most written responses (not ratings) that '''describe''' punishments are usually either positive or negative, not somewhere in the middle. This suggests to us that the feedback we’ve received is based on player experiences moreso than hollistic concerns - which can be attributed back to speciific Staff members and practises.

Internally, Staff members decision making looks a bit like this: - '''Major decisions''' are made through finding a consensus within administrations. This is usually reserved for members who are well integrated into the community, repeat offenders, or otherwise present a challenge in issuing a fair punishment. - '''Intermediary decisions''' are made by two or more Staff members, usually by raising the intent to punish a player in Staff channel and someone senior (either by tenure or rank) weighing in. More often than not, this is when players break rules but the degree of violation is unclear and context is highly-relevant. - '''Day-to-day decisions''' are usually made by the individual Staff member, training Staff members tend to double check with their mentor or another Staff member, however trend to issuing their own punishments as they progress through their trial period. These can be dealing with trolls, obvious rule-breaking, etc.

These processes are informal, however they have defined all punishments issued within the last month. This is important to consider because it means a lot of the disciplinary decision making process is consultative of peers. While this serves as a form of internal control, server leadership recognises it can be subjective depending on who is available for advice, and what is recommended may vary from one individual to another.

Recently, the server has focused on documenting more [https://wiki.democracycraft.net/policies/staff/staffguide Staffing Policy], and refreshed our [https://wiki.democracycraft.net/rules Rules] to be simpler to read and interpret. In addition to this, we may need to explore documenting in Staff policy examples of punishments for each type of rule category to provide a consistent point of reference for the day-to-day punishments that make up a bulk of our punishments. - We used to have something similar in our earlier days, however Staff would often become hesitant to punish outside such rigid guidelines. So consideration needs to be made to make sure the guidelines are exactly what they are called, guidelines, and not be-it-end-all stipulations.

A positive change however, has been the introduction of an internal <code>/punish</code> command that launched alongside the new Rules page. It contains structured punishment reasons to ensure disciplinary action links back to a category in our Rules page that you can read clearly.

All in all, these results are decent for Punishments - however we set a high standard for punishment expectations and intend to be even better by the next feedback survey!

<span id="available-staff"></span>
=== Available Staff ===

Players report on average <code>2-3</code> staff members being online during the hours they play on the server. This is decent given our size, however what is most commonly reported is that there are '''no staff members present for players playing in Asian timezones'''.

This is a tricky issue, given most of our playerbase is American, with Europeans as a close second. Indians are also rapidly growing category of players, which I believe is why more players on our feedback survey have reported seeing no Staff online. While our demographics remain largly the same, we recognise we need to compensate for these shifts.

A handful of new Staff members haev been headhunted to replace existing inactive Staff members, and provide more around-the-clock coverage. Unfortunately none have come from our Asian playerbase, however fortunately a lot of them cover unique hours (probably due to terrible sleep schedules..!) which should help substantially.

As always, we are on the lookout for more Staff. It helps us greatly if you recommend peers you think are a good fit to apply!

<span id="server"></span>
== Server ==

79.78% of respondants rated us 8 or above! This is undoubtably a great score, however there is still room for improvement as always. Our overall server rating has remained the same for the past year or so.

<span id="how-can-we-improve"></span>
=== How can we improve? ===

* A lot of players aren’t sure.
** 25% of players say it can’t be improved (meaning they gave us a perfect score!)
* Reducing server-side lag (a very popular ask).
* Reimplement the Friends plugin (a very popular ask).
* Fairer punishments
** Thoughts on what to do were discussed earlier.
* Adding back in-game Seasons.
** Not sure how to do this one currently, conceptually the community was supportive of the feature - however it was divisive ultimately for how it changed textures.
* More economic diversity.
** This comes mainly in the form of players requesting more niches, and more job titles.
* More roleplay opportunities.
* New onboarding process for players, and more inclusion within the community in general.
* More ‘scenario based’ events (i.e. purge).
** This was a very interesting and original suggestion to read.
** We’ll be thinking of some ways to incorperate more of these events, given they are widely popular among players…
* Better communication of server changes.
** We’ve recognised the #changelog channel on Discord isn’t enough unfortunately.
** We are exploring making monthly blog posts to summarise major changes, as well as fixes and improvements.

<span id="server-features"></span>
=== Server Features ===

We asked players to rate ten features of our server on a scale of one to five. Based on an aggregate score (total points earned per category), here are the results: 1. Discord Organisation (407 points) - This one scored the highest, it wasn’t even a close contest. - Only thing I can think of to improve (given no improvements were suggested) is to make verifying more clear, and deportation reflect on our Discord server more clearly. 2. Economy and Business Roleplay (389 points) - The introduction of DemocracyBusinesses, DemocracyTrade, and DemocracyTreasury updates has greatly immersed the server economy. - A lot of custom features have created new jobs recently (i.e. Carpenter) which I imagine has helped a lot. - Diversity and complexity is still however lacking, and being looked into. 3. Political Roleplay (376 points) - Despite a high rating, a lot of players report they aren’t happy with the conduct of certain players. This is interesting because a lot of players recognise it’s not a deal breaker or don’t consider it an objective marker for dissatisfaction. - I believe we’re lacking some engagement, especially with voting turnouts. - More will be done by the server to promote voting during election seasons and proactive voter registration in-game. 4. Communication from Staff (369 points) - A lot of communication lies in how we communicate disciplinary action. We’re working on getting a web interface for our punishments again, and may look into more elaborate or “secondary” reasons to attach to our heavier punishments as this keeps getting raised. - We’re unsure at this stage what this would look like. 5. Legal Roleplay and Forums Organisation (Tied at 369 points) - The legal side of the server isn’t an easy pathway to begin with, more research needs to be done in terms of reducing the barriers of entry from a server-side perspective. - Forums structure wise is passable, however it remains difficult to navigate. Some decisions will need to be made on how to address this - we welcome suggestions especially on how. 6. City Life RP (338 points) - Players are quick to point out the server simply does not engage in traditional role playing. - Server administration has taken the increase in interest in roleplay as a sign we need to start implementing opt-in (highly encouraged) roleplay. More details will follow as we start implementing new features to deal with this. 7. Server Performance (305 points) - Server ticks-per-second (TPS) has not been scaling well with players. - This wasn’t largly dealt with until I got back from my hiatus. Since then, several major causes have been eliminated. - Two plugins are still causing issues due to their structural choices. We’re working with the developer of them to get it fixed, it’s quite a complicated issue to do with databases. 8. Criminal Roleplay (296 points) - Players frequently complain there isn’t much depth to criminal roleplay, with the current policing state being overbearing. - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12LUTup0TUa3RTRLHfrcy7fM9z51iFi79jRiRcXfyScE/ DemocracyCrime] is a plugin we’ve commissioned to replace policing, it signals a shift into more roleplay-focused gameplay and more opportunities for criminals to predominantly engage in crime. 9. Relationship Roleplay (274 points) - Admittedly this is none existent. End has been thinking about expanding our marriage plugin to include more roles (families!), however it has been a low priority given our limited resources. The above all take priority before this, for now. 10. We had a tie, so no 10th. :p

{{Note||| About Custom Furniture 66% of you reported that you found the Custom Furniture update to be '''excellent''' (8 or above). This was a bit underwhelming for me as the person primarily response for implementing the feature. I imagine this will improve with adoption of more furniture in-game, as well as improvements to furniture. :)}}

<span id="concluding-thoughts"></span>
== Concluding Thoughts ==

I’d first like to thank '''crytiee''' for running this survey, '''we had 94 respondants, which is a new record!''' Crytiee’s persistant reminders and emphasis on our Supreme Crates raffle has went a long way to getting you lot to respond, and I couldn’t be more grateful. As someone who reads ''all'' these responses come time for each survey, I have a few takeaways from this:

* I believe we’re finally aligning with the priorities of the common player.
** A lot of the feedback from previous months surrounded concerns we didn’t have our priorities straight. I saw no mention this time around, which is a positive sign.
* There is a strong, renewed faith in senior administration.
** I attribute that to each member of senior administration’s hard work in taking feedback on board.
** It’s not the easiest to read some of these comments, (you lot can be brutal!), but you guys are also very fair.
** I’ve strongly felt the changes I made based on prior feedback is recognised in this survey and has been rewarded appropriately, which is a great motivator for myself and my peers to improve!
* With the exception of Staff Punishments, structurally players are feeling that the Staff team has improved recently. A lot of our new hires have also had very positive reception. Awesome!
* The changes we’ve made in the past month to introduce new features have been well received.

All in all, I believe this survey has shown an appetite for change that we’re looking to fill and a sense of renewed optimism in the server that we intend to keep going.

If you’ve made it this far, I’d like to thank you for reading this blog post. Hopefully you’ve found this informative, it was a lot to write and I’m hoping as we do more of these so will my writing skills!

Yours faithfully,

Tech

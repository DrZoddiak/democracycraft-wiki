# Welcome
Welcome to this week's changelog! We had a quiet week regarding rolling out changes and implementing new items. However, we are still working on things in the background!!!! 

# Features
- Nothing has been added this week!

# Government
- The government tutorial hologram for 'Cabinet' was changed to green.
- Reveille Prison
  - The Department of Health added a clinic!
- Voter registration public announcement
  - Added into a rolling announcement chain in chat.
- Department of Construction and Transportation
  - Added reason code 'Rental Limitations' to eviction report form

# Staff
- Fuel is disabled for the custom textured vehicles from MTVehicles.
  - Is a potential temporary change
- Furniture per chunk doubled to **20**
:::note
We should take a slow and cautious approach to changing this limit. We don't want to lag players out. If you notice your client side needs to catch up, reduce the number of these items in your area.
:::

- Rollout of new feature logging system.
  - Designed to assist with backend management of ongoing project development.
- Rollout of new 'Bug Tracking' system.
  - This will ensure that system support staff can see what bugs are being worked on and the triage to clear them out.

# Summary
Overall, the server didn't see much downtime this week. We are happy to see its performance and stability remain in great standing. Thanks for staying updated, and be sure to check back next week for more exciting changes!

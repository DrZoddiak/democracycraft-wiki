Welcome back and welcome in to this weeks release of the rolling Changelog. As we wrap up the month of July we are excited to see some upcoming changes as well as enhancements to the servers backend.

<span id="features"></span>
= Features =

* Server has been updated to Minecraft '''1.21'''
** Thereâ€™s a lot of cool stuff and performance updates with this one, also a lot of breaking changes.
** DemocracyDiseases is '''OFFLINE'''! :(. Weâ€™re working on our new '''DemocracyHealth''' plugin to replace our existing pluginâ€¦ keep an eye out ðŸ‘€
** Some vehicles '''ARE NOT WORKING''', weâ€™re waiting on some fixes from plugin developer(s).
* The sunsetting of Dynmap has opened the door to '''BlueMap''' the latest and more realistic view for map imaging!
** '''Check it out!''' https://map.democracycraft.net/
* Tech did a yap session within server announcements for some unknown reasonâ€¦.
* Hunter Payouts has been updated to be more inline with a previous version of the plugin.
** New mobs have been added with appropriate payout values.
** Mobs: Armadillo, Breeze, Bogged
* Removal of gloval booster for increased money/xp gain on Saturdays.
** Sadly no more grindy grindy on the saturday nights. Looking specifically at Berryâ€¦
* Book oâ€™ Brews has been updated to function on 1.21 natively!
* Crafters are now able to be locked
** Thanks end for not deleting the server while you implemented this!
* Flower Recipes are now properly working in-game and are live.

<div class="note">

The system staff donâ€™t allow end to do much when it comes to editing or pushing updates. This is a direct result to the server previously being down for a couple days due to him breaking a database previously.


</div>
* New Chat Filter has been implemented to prevent further abuse!
** While the changelog on discord says you can call Nacho a whale, it was written in bad faith.
** You can '''only''' call tech a non-male.
** Japan was also added to the whitelist.
* Fuel for the original vehicles has been fixed, however it has a new tag. If you need your fuel replaced, please open a staff-ticket in-game and a staff member will replace it for you. You must have your old fuel on you to receive new fuel.
** MTVehicles still do not require fuel!
* Crate Rewards formating
** Made formating for the rewards a bit clearer and more clean when reading them!

<span id="government"></span>
= Government =

* Postman Harry has joined the postal legion and is located in the post office in Oakridge!
* Construction &amp; Transportation Department
** Updated and added the Bus Stop back to the university location

* Town role naming conventions, have been updated on the backend. Please see the below changes.
** Town mayor specific | <code>mayor-&lt;town&gt;</code> changes to <code>&lt;town&gt;-mayor</code>
** Town resident specific | <code>resident-&lt;town&gt;</code> changes to <code>&lt;town&gt;-resident</code>
** Town councilor specific | <code>councilor-&lt;town&gt;</code> changes to <code>&lt;town&gt;-councillor</code>
* About Menu Updated, to reflect the new naming conventions
** This will not change the functionality of the plugin just the backend support
* Removal of the â€˜Mayorâ€™ parent role, has been removed to make it town specific
** Addition of town specific mayor role(s), added for versatility between each town, rather an umbrella effect.
* Removal of Proimity Chat, do to the lack of use.
* Removed un-used jobs from SkillsManager
** Digger, Enchanter, Builder
* Gradients and Custom nicknames have been patched and working properly again.
* Crashes mitigated, due to an issue arrising from the 1.21 update DC has pushed an update to paper to resolve this going forward.
** This will help a couple thousand servers in the long run!

# Managing #changelog
The changelog channel on our main [Discord server](https://discord.gg/democracy) is an important platform for us as Staff to communicate changes to the server to our players. This guide serves as formalised policy on how to post your changes in the channel, as well as prepare a periodic blog post.

## End of Period
Currently, we publish blog posts: Weekly

### Every Sunday
Complete your blog post and put it in ``#server-announcements``. The format for the Discord announcement should be:

```
:dc::VBar:**CHANGELOG AS AT YYYY-MM-DD**:VBar::dc: 

Please include here a brief sentence, maybe two at most.
:dot: **Read here!** <link>

@Server

```

Replace ``<link>`` with a link to your blog post. The format for a blog post is below.

## Blog Post

### Every Sunday

Create your blog post file by copying and editing the file formatted below.

- File name: ``YYYY-MM-DD-changelog.md``
- File path: ``/blog/``

```

# Summary
Another three sentences, keep it brief. You can say whatever you want (within reason).


```

- I used "- None." as an example, of when you have nothing to say.
- You don't need to include images at all, but at a max, have three reasonably sized images.
- **If you are creating a blog post for the first time**, you need to be added as an author to the blog. Ask Technofied or Nacholebraa for this to be done for you!
  - Either one of them will provide you with your name, to replace ``yourname``.

The intent of this post is to be brief and informative! :)

## That's all, folks!
Good job on making it this far. :)

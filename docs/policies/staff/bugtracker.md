## How to File an Issue

### Step 1. Open Github Projects
Open our [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/MinecraftCitiesNetwork/projects/2) board.

### Step 2. Triaging
Navigate to the ``To Triage`` column, and click ``+Add Item``.

### Step 2.2. Add a description to your Issue 
You will now see your issue filed in the ``To Triage`` column, open it and add a description by clicking the ``Edit`` button **under** the title.

### Step 3. Turn the issue into an Issue
5. In the same editor menu, on the right hand side you will see ``Convert to an Issue``. This is the last step you'll need to complete. Click on it, then select **Bugs**.

## All done!
Hooray!

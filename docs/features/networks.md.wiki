DemocracyCraft has one of the most expansive in-game player-to-player economies on Minecraft, this naturally means a lot of shops to buy from and sell to.

However, with several thousand entities in-game, this becomes laggy for the players more than it does for the server. For that reason, we’ve implemented a networking system to sort and filter your chests '''without''' the use of hoppers!

<span id="create-your-components"></span>
== Create your components ==

In any network, you will need '''input, sorting and miscellaneous''' containers, and a '''network wand''' to configure them.

<span id="network-wand"></span>
=== Network Wand ===

This wand will be used to configure the filters for your sorting containers, and view more information about your network components. - '''Right Click''' on any network container with the wand in your main hand to view details. - '''Sneak + Left Click''' on any sorting container to add a filter. - You must have the item you are filtering in your off-hand, and the wand in your main hand. - The sorting container will “filter” the item you specified in your off-hand, by grabbing them from input containers that are part of the same network. - '''Left Click''' to toggle the wand to Priority mode, or back to Filter mode. - If you are in Priority mode, you can choose which sorting containers are to be filled the quickest. - '''Shift + Right Click''' with the wand to increase the priority of a container. - '''Shift + Left Click''' with the wand to decrease the priority of a container.

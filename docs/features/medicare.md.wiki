<span id="how-does-this-work"></span>
== How Does This Work? ==

Each time you are treated (excluding pharmacy goods) by a Government doctor in the Hospital, instead of paying through your own balance via <code>/pay</code>, you are entitled to be covered by using Medicare. Instead of running <code>/pay</code>, you run <code>/medicarepay</code> and provide the doctor’s username and click on what disease you were treated for. This way, your treatment is covered by the Government and alleviates medical expenses that you may have.

Everyone automatically has Medicare when they join.

<span id="commands"></span>
== Commands ==

<code>/medicarepay username</code> - Opens up the GUI for Medicare.

Replace ‘username’ with the username of the Doctor who has treated you and then click on what disease you were treated for. The Doctor, as per usual, will always ask that you pay '''before you receive''' the treatment.

'''Abuse of this command will result in warnings, fines, and possible termination of your Medicare depending on discretion from the Department of Health.'''

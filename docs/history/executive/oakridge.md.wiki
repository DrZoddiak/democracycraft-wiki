=== Early History ===

On November 20th, 2020, Oakridge was opened to the public. The town’s popularity grew quickly and on the 8th of January, 2021, Oakridge’s first expansion happened. The expansion consisted of rentable stalls, a police station, a pharmacy, and a pier. One of Oakridge’s major changes happened on the 8th of April, 2021: All drugs were made legal. This brought waves of new players and business owners to Oakridge as now selling drugs did not require citizens to have a black market stall. ''Zab''’s leadership came to an end in June as he stepped down from his position as mayor. After ''Zab'' stepped down, Oakridge had its first mayoral election which ended on the 25th of June, 2021. At the end of the election, the next mayor of Oakridge, 1950Minecrafter, was elected.

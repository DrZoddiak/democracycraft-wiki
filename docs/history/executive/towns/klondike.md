# Klondike

## Overview
Klondike is DemocracyCraft’s newest town and functions as Redmont’s mining town. The town follows a steampunk theme and drafted its constitution on November 16th, 2021. Klondike strives for a just, fair, and tranquil society as seen in the town’s constitution’s preamble.

Klondike’s main industries include industrial plots, mines, lodges and resorts, caves, and ice fishing. The town was modeled after the territory of Yukon in Canada, but slowly grew away from its touristy theme and now focuses more on steampunk builds.

Klondike comprises four (4) districts: Residential, commercial, industrial, and government. The town's commercial center is roughly based on the shops and businesses in Diagon Alley from the Harry Potter series.

Klondike is based off of the Canadian region of Yukon which is home to a city also named Klondike. Redmont’s Klondike was named after Canada’s Klondike, as seen in the town’s application.

## History

On September 12th, 2021, Tylxr69 (now Tylxrfied) submitted the town application for Klondike. After a little under a month (October 9th), then secretary of state xEndeavour accepted the application thus officially marking the creation of the town. Klondike’s opening day took place on November 26th, hosting an ice boat racing competition, a snowball fight, and snowball easter egg hunt. After the festivities ended, Klondike’s rental regions were open to the public via auctions on the town’s discord server. 
The transition from Hamilton to Reveille marked several large changes in Klondike, notably a major theme change (cabins and ski resort theme to steampunk theme) and the removal of Klondike’s train. During the town’s third electoral term, then mayor SnoWhiteBeard stepped down from their position. Due to this, Tylxrfied stepped down from his role as deputy mayor and ascended to the position of mayor. However, Klondike’s constitution does not state that this is proper protocol, thus sparking a lawsuit titled The_Donuticus vs. Town of Klondike on December 16th, 2022.

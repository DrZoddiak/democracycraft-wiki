# Political Parties

## Overview

A political party is a group of individuals who share common political beliefs, goals, and ideologies, and work together to influence public policy and govern a society. These parties play a crucial role in representative democracies, as they provide a platform for citizens to organize themselves around specific ideas and compete for political power through elections.

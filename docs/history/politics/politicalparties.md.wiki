# #* We will add a stock market and the option to become a broker. Only brokers will be able to invest and the rest of the players will have to buy from them if they want shares.
# #* We will give a starter kit to the new players. This kit includes: some food, some materials, and a book with a little bit of information about the server (this includes the most important rules and laws)
# #* We believe that Villagers should have the right to live in peace without violence. We will ban Villager murder completely. Also Villages are government property so they cannot be destroyed.
# #* We will give all departments the right to close course applications if needed.
# #* We will make the doctor qualification a litte bit harder and more expensive to get.
# #* We will be open to make a debate in the congress about making more warps (like University, Hospital or the Farmlands).
# #* We want to make a law saying that only farmers and haunters will be allowed to kill animals like sheeps, cows or pigs in order to make it more roleplay. This point will be decided in a debate in the congress in order to know what people think about it.
# #* We will create a guide of prices so everyone can have an idea of the price that their products may have. People won’t be obligated to set those prices, they will be able to sell at the price they find reasonable, but they Will have this guide so that they can make an idea of the market.
# #* We will make the government to set up the courts.
# #* All ideologies will be respected, from fascism to communism or liberalism. We think that everyone has the right to express their opinion, whatever it may be. We also respect every gender.
# #* We support the idea of creating new towns, but we also think that we should wait some time until we are more people on the server before creating new ones. Maybe we could add the Towny plugin in a future.
# #* We don’t think an army is needed at the moment, we think that the DoJ is enough for now, by the way, if an army is needed some day, we will support the creation of it, though we will try our best not to need one.
# #* We think the electoral cycle should be reduced to 1.5-2 months
# #* We’ll make sure that crimes such as murder, will be punished more severely

<span id="national-syndicalist-revolutionary-party"></span>
=== 9. National Syndicalist Revolutionary Party ===

'''National Syndicalist Revolutionary Party''' abbreviated as NSR is an anti-federal Political Party. It was Registered on December 30, 2020, by its Leader, cheesypig. Later, it was Deregistered on March 12, 2021 at the request of the Party Leader.

<span id="political-agenda-11"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Political: We are anti-federal, and believe in a unitary and centralized system of political governance. We believe in the political concepts of the unitary executive theory (strongly unitary) We believe that the executive branch, the president to be specific, should be able to institute a state of exception in exceptional circumstances (lol).

Economic/Fiscal/Monetary: The entire economic fabric of DC should be changed and the Capitalist system should be dismantled in favor of a corporatist/syndicalist economic structure, where all employers and workers join together in different “corporations” (not companies, but more like guilds or syndicate type organizations) based on similar interests (i.e. manufacturing, agriculture, etc.); these corporations would represent different sectors of the economy. The employer and employee, with the guidance and moderation of government officials, will negotiate all aspects of production, work, and wages. There would be 7 different corporative groups that would be created: manufacturing/industrial, agriculture, mining, medical, legal, finance, and public servants. The list isn’t definitive and it could change later. It’s to give an idea for the next point. With this considered, the legislative branch should be fundamentally changed. Personally, seeing that the Senate and House are almost the same thing in every aspect, the house should be completely changed. The House should be renamed the “Corporative Chamber” and each corporation (7 in total) will vote in one person to represent them, for 7 representatives in total. This chamber would be responsible for negotiating and voting on economic matters. The Senate, on the other hand, will vote on political matters, as usual. We believe that the healthcare system should stay controlled by the government. We also believe that the banks should be controlled by the people, for the people. The government should look into creating more state-owned enterprises (especially once the server gets bigger). The government should lower taxes when it can. However, if taxes need to stay high, then we should keep it that way. We support a Basic Income, but not universal. It should only be for new players (for the first few (2?) months), as well as people who are below a certain income and/or net worth. We support more protections for tenants. We support enacting anti-gouging laws.

Social: We support being tough-on-crime, and an increased use of jail time as a punishment, as well as increasing fines for certain crimes. Crimes against the state should also have increased punishments from what they currently are (i.e. Corruption). Also, the “public indecency” with a minor thing should be a permanent ban, not just a 3 day ban. We believe in decreasing regulation on guns. We believe that every person should be armed with a gun, but training should be mandatory. Also, non-armorers should be able to sell their own guns to other people (not with stores/chests, that should be illegal, and sales between non-armorers should be reported to the government). Speech should be less restricted on non-global chat. We should be more patriotic (more flags, etc)

Misc: Undisturbed villages should be officially protected and considered to be de jure government property. Therefore, looting and griefing of villages and the murder of the villagers in that village should be illegal. Things such as adding a road that leads to the village should be allowed, but only with explicit permission from the Government.

=== 12. United Democratic Movement ===

The '''United Democratic Movement''' abbreviated as UDM was a Democratic Political Party. It was registered on May 6, 2021, by its Party Leader, Louderleo. The party was deregistered on May 26, 2021, per the request of its Leader.

<span id="political-agenda-14"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Economics:

Lowering taxes and rearranging the budget properly so that the taxes collected in the budget are used again by the people and not by the bureaucracy. Our approach is - less money for bureaucracy, more money for people and businesses.

UDM supports the development of a free market economy and the development of economic policies that focus on accelerating economic growth, reducing unemployment, stabilizing prices and increasing citizens’ incomes.

Our plan includes:

* Review of punishment measures for economic crimes.
* Imposing taxes not on citizens’ balances, but on their business income.
* Lifting restrictions on personal property and monitoring their use to avoid monopolizing personal property.

By actually implementing the “small government” model, lower taxes, less interference in people and business, and fiscal discipline, targeted social policies can accelerate the country’s economic development, create more jobs, overcome poverty and unemployment, raise living standards and, as a result, increase prosperity, ensuring development and social protection for every citizen.

The biggest problem of the economy today is the existence of numerous companies that employ only one or two people. This leads to economic instability, excessive bureaucratic workload and minimization of jobs.

It is necessary to regulate, to create and register a company it will be necessary to employ a certain number of people.

This will guarantee that every citizen will have the opportunity to be employed and free the economy from inactive companies, which will further increase the economic potential and provide more space for new companies in the free market.

Human Rights and Justice:

* Liberal and crime prevention-oriented criminal policy.
* Extension of civil rights in disputes with the state.
* Creating effective mechanisms to protect human rights and effective anti-discrimination policies.
* Court Arbitration System: At the request of the accused, the court will move to the jury system. Following a trial conducted by a judge, an arbitral tribunal composed of citizens shall, by independent and transparent voting, render a verdict against the accused. If the arbitral tribunal finds the person guilty, the judge will decide on the form of the sentence.
* Relocation of judicial structure, buildings and institutions to other cities in order to decentralize the country politically and socially.*

Urban Development:

* Establish an urban planning council to ensure the development of existing cities and the establishment of new cities.
* Establish a City Appearance, Development and Monitoring Council to establish regulations in cities and ensure they are monitored to make cities more organized and attractive.
* Development of existing cities and their improvement, decentralization of urban life in the country.
* Relocation of judicial structure, buildings and institutions to other cities in order to decentralize the country politically and socially.*

“Our allegiance is to the republic, to democracy!”

<span id="political-agenda-21"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Economic policies Expanding on government contracts as well as government supply drop boxes (any player dumps resources in order to fund a project). Easier access to job information and reworking the lackluster jobs (such as the miner) to be more useful. This will also mean reworking tests. Promoting more businesses and charity organizations through grants and discounts for properties in towns. A more expansive banking system with interest and loans. More funding of towns but still understanding that plots in the city are important. Transportation policies Easier access to key points of interest (such as the hospital) as well as cheaper transportation to towns. Information policies It is vital to give easy access to information in-game or players might be discouraged by the extensive forums. We will expand upon easy-to-access information by making books more specific to a topic of interest for new players. Full transparency with the public in order to promote a healthy democracy. Participation Policies In order to promote participation, giving players money and/or resources should promote increased participation in the government. Foreign policies Our main focus is on Redmont, not other servers. If an opportunity arises that will make Redmont stronger, we will take it.

=== 33. Tea Party ===

The '''Tea Party''' abbreviated as TEA was registered on March 2, 2023 under the Leadership of GoldBlooded. The Party deregistered on April 6, 2023, due to the request of its Party Leader.

<span id="political-agenda-34"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

POLICIES Fiscal Responsibility: The party would prioritize responsible fiscal policies, advocating for lower taxes and reduced government spending in order to balance the budget. The government will keep the amount of money it takes from citizens in taxes low, so people can keep more of their hard-earned money.

Free market economics: The party would support free market capitalism and believe that the economy operates best when businesses are allowed to operate with minimal government interference.

Deregulation: Advocate for reducing government regulations on businesses to prevent stifling innovation and hindering economic growth.

Limited government: The party would advocate for limiting the size and scope of government, reducing government spending and promoting individual responsibility.

Personal freedom: Prioritize individual liberty and personal responsibility, opposing government interference in personal matters.

Lower, and eventually abolish, minimum commission in favor of a chest shop tax. Privatization of the healthcare industry. Raiseplot ownership limits. Public Business Transparency Promote Starting Guides Give Newcomers Platforms To Jumpstart Their Careers, Join The Workforce, And Learn! Introduce Extensive Department Bonuses, Funded By Increased Revenue Reward Good, Active, And Beneficial Departmental Work Make The Overall Government Job Sector, Seem Less Intimidating To Newcomers. Promote Union Activity Support Towns in their own plans, and only get involved when absolutely necessary. Revise the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Allow For a More Integrated Criminal Role-Play Experience. Establish Town Court Buildings. Focus on problems at home rather than abroad. Reconsider our involvement in the United Nations and the international sphere.

We believe in the right of individuals to pursue their own lives, so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. We believe in the limited role of government, and recognize that the government should be a force for good, but should not intrude upon the rights of the individual. We support the free market and the right of individuals to engage in free trade. We believe in the rule of law, and that everyone should be held accountable for their actions.

The Tea Party is your representative in Redmont’s political scene. As the only party which truly respects you as a player, we prioritize individual liberties over all else. We are committed to the integrity of the government and free markets. It is our goal to bring power to you, as a player, worker, and businessperson. Come sip some tea with us.

Our agenda is, broadly, to improve the living conditions of the working people of Redmont, to improve their wages and fight against exploitation.

The Party deregisteration is not stated.

<span id="political-agenda-39"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Crime -Balance out criminals and police officers, the roleplay needs to have more crime. Criminals should have the opportunity to get away with their crimes, and baiting criminals to spawn for arrests should not be legal. -Players have an option to register their own gang. Gangs are a way of expanding criminal roleplay and criminal opportunities; they will act to make crime more fair, and hand a possibility to criminals to effectively organize. -Allow clearly defined in-game threats to kill a player to be reported for a fine. -Increase the number of activities within prison to make crime a less boring playstyle when caught.

Business -Limit the number of businesses you can own to five. Spamming businesses to take advantage of the system should not be allowed. -Newly created companies would be eligible for an additional $1,000 materials/startup grant, to help them get on their feet. Players may be made responsible for showing how the funds were used to prevent abuse.

Government -Leaked information about elections or personal government chats will be criminalized, and subject to fines. -We support a review of the Constitution and laws to ensure that they accurately reflect the needs of the playerbase; this includes being clear, and protecting the in-game roleplay rights of players. -Create a simplistic register of laws for new players to skim through, so they can see the laws that are most relevant to them without having to scroll through tons of forum posts wondering what matters and what doesn’t.

Information -All members will be informed of policies and actions made by the party. -Although members are not required to agree with each other, or the party, 100% of the time, respect is a critical part of our discussion and debate and is required of all members. -Explanations of party actions, when given, will be thorough and transparent so the membership is aware of why decisions were made the way they were. -The Chairman of the DMP will be the Founder. Future changes to party structure may be implemented by the Chairman; however, polls of the party may be taken to survey support for proposed actions. Additionally, other party positions such as the Campaign Manager and Advisor to the Chairman may be elected by the members of the party. -During a contentious election season, where many members wish to run, the Chairman may choose to hold a primary to help narrow down the candidate or candidates that will run. The primary may be conducted according to plurality voting, instant runoff voting, or single transferable vote voting depending on the situation.

# UBI Abuse must end UBI should only be given to those who work for it.
# Scrap Medicare for all Medicare for all was set up as a ponzi scheme, and im ending that today.
# Close the Border Too many useless immigrants flow in everyday, frankly some of these people are not up to the standard we expect, they need to be either sent back on the boats or put to work for the glory of Redmont. Additionally, A Border Office needs to be established to handle this crisis with special powers.
# Town Autonomy Towns need representation at the federal level and Mayors and town councils should be elected, democracy isn’t optional - Redmont isn’t an authoritarian state.
# Pull out of the UN. We have no need to negotiate with terrorists, if they want to surrender they need to crawl on their hands and knees through the dirt - not on the marbled floor of the UN building.
# Tighten the Purse Strings Our nation is in a recession and all congress has done about it is give themselves a raise, we need to balance the books today.

=== 43. Redmont Reform Coalition ===

The '''Redmont Reform Coalition''' abbreviated as RRC was registered on October 19, 2023, under the Leadership of BezzerGeezer.

The Party deregistered due to the lack of members with inactivities.

<span id="political-agenda-44"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Our economy is a shell of its former self. The average citizen is unable to achieve a comfortable living and our government must take action to make prosperity attainable. Tax reform is the first step in accomplishing this task. The RRC will support tax reductions on the individual. The RRC supports a capital gains tax to ensure that the wealthiest in society are paying their fair share. After reforming our tax system, the RRC will focus on ensuring the welfare of our lower class and new citizens. These groups have been routinely ignored by our government in favor of enriching those who are already wealthy. The RRC will deliver an economic relief package and welfare programs for our new citizens and lower class. The RRC will bolster the education system to make it more engaging and informative so that new citizens are better equipped to transition into society. The RRC will seek to form partnerships between the University and businesses to create immediate job opportunities for new citizens. The RRC will also seek to provide tax relief for foundations and charities that seek to aid needy and new citizens.

There’s been a degradation of our nation’s democracy. Transparency, trust, and unity all seem to be slipping through our fingers. In order to restore Redmont’s democracy, we must seek quality representation, and we must institute policies which will bring back transparency, trust, and unity. The RRC will work hard to ensure that its members of congress are active and legislating for the people they were elected to represent. The RRC will encourage regular press releases from its elected officials to stay in touch with the public on why they’re making certain decisions. The RRC will do its best to be a party of listeners who are able to effectively articulate and legislate the will of the people of Redmont. The RRC will seek to hold more press conferences and hold more in-game sessions of Congress and other government proceedings. Attention should be specifically focused on rebuilding Redmont’s trust in its institutions. In order to do this we must seek to limit partisanship within our most influential branches of government. The RRC will work hard to craft workable policy to ensure the impartiality of members of our judicial system. The RRC will also seek to remove all potential partisanship in our electoral officers by ensuring that they are in no way politically affiliated.

<span id="political-agenda-47"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

10 Measures to Improve Redmont Active Congress. We want to improve Congress activity, specially after the last terms being kind of inactive or not being as active as it could be. That’s why we want to propose to make more in-game activities such as 1 in-game session every week, in-game committees, etc. Fighting corruption. We will hold accountable every single politician, no matter who. We will investigate where we have to in order to keep corruption away from Redmont’s institutions. Integrity and Accountability. We are not here to earn money, we are not here to get personal benefit, we are also not perfect. We are here to do our best to improve Redmont. That’s why we will always think of the benefit of the country before of our personal benefit, and if we found ourselves in a situation in which that is not happening, we will resign. Transparency. We will propose in Congress to have a weekly or bi-weekly Press Conference by the Speaker and each party spokesperson in the Capitol. In any case, the SPR will commit to do those Press Conferences in our HQ (until we have a new one, we will make them in a public theater), even if Congress doesn’t approve weekly or bi-weekly Press Conferences in the Capitol. 1 Senator for each town. It’s time for towns to have a voice in Federal politics. Towns should have someone to raise their voice in Congress, and that’s why we propose that each town has 1 Senator in the Senate, which currently would result in a total of 3 Senators. They would be elected in their town. Public Participation. We are convinced that Democracy is a system in which the people takes part in the political process. And so, we think that we must ensure that happens in Redmont. That’s why we propose that if a representative thinks that a certain bill should go to referendum (even if it isn’t mandatory by the Constitution), they can present a Motion of Referendum before the 2 Chambers and the 2 Chambers would vote. If they have either an absolute majority or a super-majority (this would be something to bring to a debate), then the bill goes to referendum Public Housing. We believe that everyone has the right to live under a roof, that’s why we think that the Government should provide, to those who can’t afford it, a place to live by building public housing. Balanced Taxes. We think taxes could be modified in some areas to improve their impact. We think we should lower residential plots taxes so poorer and new players can have it easier to get a place to live. For commercial plots we propose the following idea: 2 weeks with no progress = the owner will have to pay 2% of the original price in taxes for the next 2 weeks. If after that time there’s still no progress = eviction and bid of the plot. This is to repeal as much as possible having unjustified empty plots. Plot Price Limit. In some areas of Reveille, we could find ourselves in a plot price crisis in which prices get high as the sky. For those cases, we propose the following idea: The Federal Government can set an area that has a lot of highly priced plots to intervene by declaring it “stressed zone”. That would allow the Government to set a price limit so they get lower, and once prices are more or less stabilized, the government can remove that stressed zone declaration and the price limit would go away. Food supply for the poor. Some people can’t afford paying for food, that’s why we think the Government should have a food storage for those who are in need.

==== Political Agenda ====

# #* We will add a stock market and the option to become a broker. Only brokers will be able to invest and the rest of the players will have to buy from them if they want shares.
# #* We will give a starter kit to the new players. This kit includes: some food, some materials, and a book with a little bit of information about the server (this includes the most important rules and laws)
# #* We believe that Villagers should have the right to live in peace without violence. We will ban Villager murder completely. Also Villages are government property so they cannot be destroyed.
# #* We will give all departments the right to close course applications if needed.
# #* We will make the doctor qualification a litte bit harder and more expensive to get.
# #* We will be open to make a debate in the congress about making more warps (like University, Hospital or the Farmlands).
# #* We want to make a law saying that only farmers and haunters will be allowed to kill animals like sheeps, cows or pigs in order to make it more roleplay. This point will be decided in a debate in the congress in order to know what people think about it.
# #* We will create a guide of prices so everyone can have an idea of the price that their products may have. People won’t be obligated to set those prices, they will be able to sell at the price they find reasonable, but they Will have this guide so that they can make an idea of the market.
# #* We will make the government to set up the courts.
# #* All ideologies will be respected, from fascism to communism or liberalism. We think that everyone has the right to express their opinion, whatever it may be. We also respect every gender.
# #* We support the idea of creating new towns, but we also think that we should wait some time until we are more people on the server before creating new ones. Maybe we could add the Towny plugin in a future.
# #* We don’t think an army is needed at the moment, we think that the DoJ is enough for now, by the way, if an army is needed some day, we will support the creation of it, though we will try our best not to need one.
# #* We think the electoral cycle should be reduced to 1.5-2 months
# #* We’ll make sure that crimes such as murder, will be punished more severely

<span id="national-syndicalist-revolutionary-party-1"></span>
=== 9. National Syndicalist Revolutionary Party ===

'''National Syndicalist Revolutionary Party''' abbreviated as NSR is an anti-federal Political Party. It was Registered on December 30, 2020, by its Leader, cheesypig. Later, it was Deregistered on March 12, 2021 at the request of the Party Leader.

<span id="political-agenda-59"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Political: We are anti-federal, and believe in a unitary and centralized system of political governance. We believe in the political concepts of the unitary executive theory (strongly unitary) We believe that the executive branch, the president to be specific, should be able to institute a state of exception in exceptional circumstances (lol).

Economic/Fiscal/Monetary: The entire economic fabric of DC should be changed and the Capitalist system should be dismantled in favor of a corporatist/syndicalist economic structure, where all employers and workers join together in different “corporations” (not companies, but more like guilds or syndicate type organizations) based on similar interests (i.e. manufacturing, agriculture, etc.); these corporations would represent different sectors of the economy. The employer and employee, with the guidance and moderation of government officials, will negotiate all aspects of production, work, and wages. There would be 7 different corporative groups that would be created: manufacturing/industrial, agriculture, mining, medical, legal, finance, and public servants. The list isn’t definitive and it could change later. It’s to give an idea for the next point. With this considered, the legislative branch should be fundamentally changed. Personally, seeing that the Senate and House are almost the same thing in every aspect, the house should be completely changed. The House should be renamed the “Corporative Chamber” and each corporation (7 in total) will vote in one person to represent them, for 7 representatives in total. This chamber would be responsible for negotiating and voting on economic matters. The Senate, on the other hand, will vote on political matters, as usual. We believe that the healthcare system should stay controlled by the government. We also believe that the banks should be controlled by the people, for the people. The government should look into creating more state-owned enterprises (especially once the server gets bigger). The government should lower taxes when it can. However, if taxes need to stay high, then we should keep it that way. We support a Basic Income, but not universal. It should only be for new players (for the first few (2?) months), as well as people who are below a certain income and/or net worth. We support more protections for tenants. We support enacting anti-gouging laws.

Social: We support being tough-on-crime, and an increased use of jail time as a punishment, as well as increasing fines for certain crimes. Crimes against the state should also have increased punishments from what they currently are (i.e. Corruption). Also, the “public indecency” with a minor thing should be a permanent ban, not just a 3 day ban. We believe in decreasing regulation on guns. We believe that every person should be armed with a gun, but training should be mandatory. Also, non-armorers should be able to sell their own guns to other people (not with stores/chests, that should be illegal, and sales between non-armorers should be reported to the government). Speech should be less restricted on non-global chat. We should be more patriotic (more flags, etc)

Misc: Undisturbed villages should be officially protected and considered to be de jure government property. Therefore, looting and griefing of villages and the murder of the villagers in that village should be illegal. Things such as adding a road that leads to the village should be allowed, but only with explicit permission from the Government.

<span id="united-democratic-movement-1"></span>
=== 12. United Democratic Movement ===

The '''United Democratic Movement''' abbreviated as UDM was a Democratic Political Party. It was registered on May 6, 2021, by its Party Leader, Louderleo. The party was deregistered on May 26, 2021, per the request of its Leader.

<span id="political-agenda-62"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Economics:

Lowering taxes and rearranging the budget properly so that the taxes collected in the budget are used again by the people and not by the bureaucracy. Our approach is - less money for bureaucracy, more money for people and businesses.

UDM supports the development of a free market economy and the development of economic policies that focus on accelerating economic growth, reducing unemployment, stabilizing prices and increasing citizens’ incomes.

Our plan includes:

* Review of punishment measures for economic crimes.
* Imposing taxes not on citizens’ balances, but on their business income.
* Lifting restrictions on personal property and monitoring their use to avoid monopolizing personal property.

By actually implementing the “small government” model, lower taxes, less interference in people and business, and fiscal discipline, targeted social policies can accelerate the country’s economic development, create more jobs, overcome poverty and unemployment, raise living standards and, as a result, increase prosperity, ensuring development and social protection for every citizen.

The biggest problem of the economy today is the existence of numerous companies that employ only one or two people. This leads to economic instability, excessive bureaucratic workload and minimization of jobs.

It is necessary to regulate, to create and register a company it will be necessary to employ a certain number of people.

This will guarantee that every citizen will have the opportunity to be employed and free the economy from inactive companies, which will further increase the economic potential and provide more space for new companies in the free market.

Human Rights and Justice:

* Liberal and crime prevention-oriented criminal policy.
* Extension of civil rights in disputes with the state.
* Creating effective mechanisms to protect human rights and effective anti-discrimination policies.
* Court Arbitration System: At the request of the accused, the court will move to the jury system. Following a trial conducted by a judge, an arbitral tribunal composed of citizens shall, by independent and transparent voting, render a verdict against the accused. If the arbitral tribunal finds the person guilty, the judge will decide on the form of the sentence.
* Relocation of judicial structure, buildings and institutions to other cities in order to decentralize the country politically and socially.*

Urban Development:

* Establish an urban planning council to ensure the development of existing cities and the establishment of new cities.
* Establish a City Appearance, Development and Monitoring Council to establish regulations in cities and ensure they are monitored to make cities more organized and attractive.
* Development of existing cities and their improvement, decentralization of urban life in the country.
* Relocation of judicial structure, buildings and institutions to other cities in order to decentralize the country politically and socially.*

“Our allegiance is to the republic, to democracy!”

<span id="political-agenda-69"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Economic policies Expanding on government contracts as well as government supply drop boxes (any player dumps resources in order to fund a project). Easier access to job information and reworking the lackluster jobs (such as the miner) to be more useful. This will also mean reworking tests. Promoting more businesses and charity organizations through grants and discounts for properties in towns. A more expansive banking system with interest and loans. More funding of towns but still understanding that plots in the city are important. Transportation policies Easier access to key points of interest (such as the hospital) as well as cheaper transportation to towns. Information policies It is vital to give easy access to information in-game or players might be discouraged by the extensive forums. We will expand upon easy-to-access information by making books more specific to a topic of interest for new players. Full transparency with the public in order to promote a healthy democracy. Participation Policies In order to promote participation, giving players money and/or resources should promote increased participation in the government. Foreign policies Our main focus is on Redmont, not other servers. If an opportunity arises that will make Redmont stronger, we will take it.

=== 33. Tea Party ===

The '''Tea Party''' abbreviated as TEA was registered on March 2, 2023 under the Leadership of GoldBlooded. The Party deregistered on April 6, 2023, due to the request of its Party Leader.

<span id="political-agenda-82"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

POLICIES Fiscal Responsibility: The party would prioritize responsible fiscal policies, advocating for lower taxes and reduced government spending in order to balance the budget. The government will keep the amount of money it takes from citizens in taxes low, so people can keep more of their hard-earned money.

Free market economics: The party would support free market capitalism and believe that the economy operates best when businesses are allowed to operate with minimal government interference.

Deregulation: Advocate for reducing government regulations on businesses to prevent stifling innovation and hindering economic growth.

Limited government: The party would advocate for limiting the size and scope of government, reducing government spending and promoting individual responsibility.

Personal freedom: Prioritize individual liberty and personal responsibility, opposing government interference in personal matters.

Lower, and eventually abolish, minimum commission in favor of a chest shop tax. Privatization of the healthcare industry. Raiseplot ownership limits. Public Business Transparency Promote Starting Guides Give Newcomers Platforms To Jumpstart Their Careers, Join The Workforce, And Learn! Introduce Extensive Department Bonuses, Funded By Increased Revenue Reward Good, Active, And Beneficial Departmental Work Make The Overall Government Job Sector, Seem Less Intimidating To Newcomers. Promote Union Activity Support Towns in their own plans, and only get involved when absolutely necessary. Revise the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Allow For a More Integrated Criminal Role-Play Experience. Establish Town Court Buildings. Focus on problems at home rather than abroad. Reconsider our involvement in the United Nations and the international sphere.

We believe in the right of individuals to pursue their own lives, so long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others. We believe in the limited role of government, and recognize that the government should be a force for good, but should not intrude upon the rights of the individual. We support the free market and the right of individuals to engage in free trade. We believe in the rule of law, and that everyone should be held accountable for their actions.

The Tea Party is your representative in Redmont’s political scene. As the only party which truly respects you as a player, we prioritize individual liberties over all else. We are committed to the integrity of the government and free markets. It is our goal to bring power to you, as a player, worker, and businessperson. Come sip some tea with us.

The Party deregisteration is not stated.

<span id="political-agenda-87"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Crime -Balance out criminals and police officers, the roleplay needs to have more crime. Criminals should have the opportunity to get away with their crimes, and baiting criminals to spawn for arrests should not be legal. -Players have an option to register their own gang. Gangs are a way of expanding criminal roleplay and criminal opportunities; they will act to make crime more fair, and hand a possibility to criminals to effectively organize. -Allow clearly defined in-game threats to kill a player to be reported for a fine. -Increase the number of activities within prison to make crime a less boring playstyle when caught.

Business -Limit the number of businesses you can own to five. Spamming businesses to take advantage of the system should not be allowed. -Newly created companies would be eligible for an additional $1,000 materials/startup grant, to help them get on their feet. Players may be made responsible for showing how the funds were used to prevent abuse.

Government -Leaked information about elections or personal government chats will be criminalized, and subject to fines. -We support a review of the Constitution and laws to ensure that they accurately reflect the needs of the playerbase; this includes being clear, and protecting the in-game roleplay rights of players. -Create a simplistic register of laws for new players to skim through, so they can see the laws that are most relevant to them without having to scroll through tons of forum posts wondering what matters and what doesn’t.

Information -All members will be informed of policies and actions made by the party. -Although members are not required to agree with each other, or the party, 100% of the time, respect is a critical part of our discussion and debate and is required of all members. -Explanations of party actions, when given, will be thorough and transparent so the membership is aware of why decisions were made the way they were. -The Chairman of the DMP will be the Founder. Future changes to party structure may be implemented by the Chairman; however, polls of the party may be taken to survey support for proposed actions. Additionally, other party positions such as the Campaign Manager and Advisor to the Chairman may be elected by the members of the party. -During a contentious election season, where many members wish to run, the Chairman may choose to hold a primary to help narrow down the candidate or candidates that will run. The primary may be conducted according to plurality voting, instant runoff voting, or single transferable vote voting depending on the situation.

# UBI Abuse must end UBI should only be given to those who work for it.
# Scrap Medicare for all Medicare for all was set up as a ponzi scheme, and im ending that today.
# Close the Border Too many useless immigrants flow in everyday, frankly some of these people are not up to the standard we expect, they need to be either sent back on the boats or put to work for the glory of Redmont. Additionally, A Border Office needs to be established to handle this crisis with special powers.
# Town Autonomy Towns need representation at the federal level and Mayors and town councils should be elected, democracy isn’t optional - Redmont isn’t an authoritarian state.
# Pull out of the UN. We have no need to negotiate with terrorists, if they want to surrender they need to crawl on their hands and knees through the dirt - not on the marbled floor of the UN building.
# Tighten the Purse Strings Our nation is in a recession and all congress has done about it is give themselves a raise, we need to balance the books today.

The Party deregistered due to the lack of members with inactivities.

<span id="political-agenda-92"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

Our economy is a shell of its former self. The average citizen is unable to achieve a comfortable living and our government must take action to make prosperity attainable. Tax reform is the first step in accomplishing this task. The RRC will support tax reductions on the individual. The RRC supports a capital gains tax to ensure that the wealthiest in society are paying their fair share. After reforming our tax system, the RRC will focus on ensuring the welfare of our lower class and new citizens. These groups have been routinely ignored by our government in favor of enriching those who are already wealthy. The RRC will deliver an economic relief package and welfare programs for our new citizens and lower class. The RRC will bolster the education system to make it more engaging and informative so that new citizens are better equipped to transition into society. The RRC will seek to form partnerships between the University and businesses to create immediate job opportunities for new citizens. The RRC will also seek to provide tax relief for foundations and charities that seek to aid needy and new citizens.

There’s been a degradation of our nation’s democracy. Transparency, trust, and unity all seem to be slipping through our fingers. In order to restore Redmont’s democracy, we must seek quality representation, and we must institute policies which will bring back transparency, trust, and unity. The RRC will work hard to ensure that its members of congress are active and legislating for the people they were elected to represent. The RRC will encourage regular press releases from its elected officials to stay in touch with the public on why they’re making certain decisions. The RRC will do its best to be a party of listeners who are able to effectively articulate and legislate the will of the people of Redmont. The RRC will seek to hold more press conferences and hold more in-game sessions of Congress and other government proceedings. Attention should be specifically focused on rebuilding Redmont’s trust in its institutions. In order to do this we must seek to limit partisanship within our most influential branches of government. The RRC will work hard to craft workable policy to ensure the impartiality of members of our judicial system. The RRC will also seek to remove all potential partisanship in our electoral officers by ensuring that they are in no way politically affiliated.

<span id="political-agenda-95"></span>
==== Political Agenda ====

10 Measures to Improve Redmont Active Congress. We want to improve Congress activity, specially after the last terms being kind of inactive or not being as active as it could be. That’s why we want to propose to make more in-game activities such as 1 in-game session every week, in-game committees, etc. Fighting corruption. We will hold accountable every single politician, no matter who. We will investigate where we have to in order to keep corruption away from Redmont’s institutions. Integrity and Accountability. We are not here to earn money, we are not here to get personal benefit, we are also not perfect. We are here to do our best to improve Redmont. That’s why we will always think of the benefit of the country before of our personal benefit, and if we found ourselves in a situation in which that is not happening, we will resign. Transparency. We will propose in Congress to have a weekly or bi-weekly Press Conference by the Speaker and each party spokesperson in the Capitol. In any case, the SPR will commit to do those Press Conferences in our HQ (until we have a new one, we will make them in a public theater), even if Congress doesn’t approve weekly or bi-weekly Press Conferences in the Capitol. 1 Senator for each town. It’s time for towns to have a voice in Federal politics. Towns should have someone to raise their voice in Congress, and that’s why we propose that each town has 1 Senator in the Senate, which currently would result in a total of 3 Senators. They would be elected in their town. Public Participation. We are convinced that Democracy is a system in which the people takes part in the political process. And so, we think that we must ensure that happens in Redmont. That’s why we propose that if a representative thinks that a certain bill should go to referendum (even if it isn’t mandatory by the Constitution), they can present a Motion of Referendum before the 2 Chambers and the 2 Chambers would vote. If they have either an absolute majority or a super-majority (this would be something to bring to a debate), then the bill goes to referendum Public Housing. We believe that everyone has the right to live under a roof, that’s why we think that the Government should provide, to those who can’t afford it, a place to live by building public housing. Balanced Taxes. We think taxes could be modified in some areas to improve their impact. We think we should lower residential plots taxes so poorer and new players can have it easier to get a place to live. For commercial plots we propose the following idea: 2 weeks with no progress = the owner will have to pay 2% of the original price in taxes for the next 2 weeks. If after that time there’s still no progress = eviction and bid of the plot. This is to repeal as much as possible having unjustified empty plots. Plot Price Limit. In some areas of Reveille, we could find ourselves in a plot price crisis in which prices get high as the sky. For those cases, we propose the following idea: The Federal Government can set an area that has a lot of highly priced plots to intervene by declaring it “stressed zone”. That would allow the Government to set a price limit so they get lower, and once prices are more or less stabilized, the government can remove that stressed zone declaration and the price limit would go away. Food supply for the poor. Some people can’t afford paying for food, that’s why we think the Government should have a food storage for those who are in need.

# Background
FlyingBlocks initially joined DemocracyCraft while looking for a fun and engaging city roleplay server on a Website. Despite the first challenges they experienced involving a scam initiated by FTGwop, a DemocracyCraft player, within the first 10 minutes of playing. FlyingBlocks recognized the server's potential, they were captivated by loads of options DemocracyCraft had in store such as making money, renting apartments, and opening shops. They decided to stick around and became a part of the DemocracyCraft Community.

# Achievements
- Players Choice Awards, 2023
  - FlyingBlocks swept the category “Best Looking Building of the Server”, securing third, second, and first places with their architectural creation. This recognition is a testament to FlyingBlock's building skills and creativity and remains a significant milestone in their time in DemocracyCraft.

# Works
FlyingBlocks has a significant number of builds in DemocracyCraft, estimated to be around 60 (including builds he had built for others). His builds are often close to Victorian architecture or architectural styles from the 1850s to 1910s.

- Abbots
  - Abbots is a department store where players can find everything they need and sell their items in exchange for money. FlyingBlocks, inspired by his love for Victorian architecture, built this grand department store. Abbots became one of his personal favorites due to the story behind Abbots, it was one of the first buildings in Reveille and expanded as FlyingBlocks acquired the other plots. Abbots has progressed to be a famous shop in DemocracyCraft, it’s well-known for its details and lag problems, but amidst that people go to Abbots, and become a place that people cherish because Abbots has provided a way for people who are just starting in the server to get their source of income. 

- Klondike Buildings
  - A memorable moment for FlyingBlocks was when Endeavor, an old Australian DemocracyCraft player, asked FlyingBlocks if he was interested in helping with building Klondike . This collaboration took place before the removal of Klondike. This became a significant point in FlyingBlocks building career in DemocracyCraft.

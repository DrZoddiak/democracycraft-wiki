# xEndeavour
1st President of Redmont 

## Preface
I'm writing this submission to the archive having had the benefit of observing five of my successor's administrations. The presidency is an office of grandeur, but also an office that requires extensive commitment and dedication. I had both the benefit and the burden of building the foundations of the government in my capacity as President, shaping the office and the wider government as it stands today. While President, I enjoyed many freedoms of discretion which my successors haven't since had - decisions were hard and fast - for better, and for worse.

My Presidency was one that pre-dated the democratic process. My greatest challenge in office was not winning an election, rather choosing the right time to implement them. It was an issue that the administration wrestled with, often butting heads with political leaders as to when and how elections would come about, however, we got there in the end. While I had every intention of Congressional elections, Presidential elections did not cross my mind as a possibility.  I was sceptical at first, however I haven't regretted it for a day since.

It was a scary prospect handing over the reigns to a player-elected individual for the first time. To be totally honest, I didn't expect it to last - we had an under-developed government which was absent of many of the complexities and niches that we see in government today. The concept of an entirely player-run government with the power that it wielded was a landmark development in the Minecraft sphere, perhaps the first of it's kind on this scale.

After months of lobbying, the Congress had convinced me that the time for an elected President had come. We started with an elected Vice-President mid year, with a full constitutional re-write in September, ahead of the October election. This was, and still remains, the biggest development in our political story. The establishment of a player-run Senate and an elected Presidential office has been a key contributor to the success of the nation. We pioneered, and we still continue to pioneer today. King Endeavour - No. Emperor Endeavour - No. Owner Endeavour - Yes. We explored many different systems before we settled on the system that you see today.

The term 'democracy' is in our name. With that, the ownership had to be a separate function to Government. The relationship the ownership have with Government was codified in our Constitution and has remained largely untouched to this day.

President is a tough gig. These individuals have a monumental role in ensuring the proper functioning of Government. With such role, they carry a significant amount of responsibility. My administration does not even compare to the complexities that these office holders have had to manage. For that, and for all that they do, I take my hat off to them. Whether you like them or not, whether you agree with them or not, these individuals run to make the nation a better place. They volunteer their time, their passion, and their dedication to the server. For this, we are indebted to them.

Attaining Presidential office is no easy feat, it takes exceptional individuals to get there.

## Major PolicY Objectives

**Establish a Stable Government**
This was a great challenge during my administration. The Cabinet was extremely fluid and therefore it became normalised for Secretaries to rotate out after 1-2 months. There were large workloads in getting departments up and running and many secretaries had little appetite to put in the work required. Establishing a stable government was one of my key policy objectives. This was a crucial step in contributing to the success of the legislative and later the elected Presidency.

**Practical Laws**
I was a significant proponent of practical and simple laws. This meant finding a balance between my own wishes and respecting the will of the legislature. I had to give the new assembly some wins, but I also needed to set a precedence and shape the law making toward beneficial, server-focused laws that are applicable to the everyday player.

## Significant Achievements

**Congressional Elections**
The introduction of the legislature was a significant moment in our political story. A chamber that represented the will of the people. A place where the players could truly make and amend the rules and laws that govern them.

**Presidential Elections**
An unexpected and initially unwanted success of my administration - never did I think it would last. Yet our political system has held true to this day. The constitution rewrite in September 2020 was the most significant change to our political system in the nation's history, guided into law by 1950minecrafter and Krix, who both worked incredibly hard to get it implemented.

**Foundations of Government**
The legacy of the End Administration continues in almost every branch of government today. The concept and structure of the government is much the same, only encountering many superficial changes since I left office.

## Controversies

**Krixmartgate**
The moving of Krixmart 12 blocks south of its original position was a decision of great controversy. This relocation was done to realign the back of spawn to the entrance of the CBD, to make it more accessible to the public and to increase competition in the immediate vicinity of spawn. When Krix refused, President End blocked off the back entrance to spawn to stop Krix benefitting from players transiting through his store to the CBD. After public pressure to reopen the entrance, a path was built down the side of spawn to direct players to the alleyway and away from walk-through stores. When negotiations fell through, President End referred the matter to Staff for the building to be forcibly moved while Krix was locked in a cage.

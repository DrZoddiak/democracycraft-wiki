# Black Market

The Black Market is an area underground where you can sell anything **without** legal prosecution. And yes, this means *anything*.

## Location

To get to the Black Market, you will need to get into the sewers. There is an entrance near Spawn to the east. You will see a little area under the train platform with an NPC named Doug. There, you will find the sewer entrance.

From there you can wander around the sewer looking for the shop, you can use `/find` if you know what you're looking for specifically, or you can use [Dynmap](https://map.democracycraft.net/#Reveille;flat;2632,64,3860;0) and toggle "Plots" on in the layers and it will show you all the plots.

## How do I get one?

There are 10 Black Market stalls in total, labeled with "bm" in the front. You can always do `/as forrent` and look, or check Discord for rental rights under Economy > Real-Estate.

# ChestShops

##  Introduction
ChestShop is a plugin that enables players to set up shops in Minecraft, allowing them to buy and sell items with ease. By placing a chest and creating a shop sign, you can establish your own virtual store in the game.

## Setting Up a Shop

### Chest Placement:
- Place a chest where you want your shop inventory to be located.
- Make sure the chest is filled with the items you want to sell or buy.

### Shop Sign:
- Place a sign on the side of the chest.
- **LINE 1:** Shop Owner. Leave this empty; it will autofill.
- **LINE 2:** Item Quantity. Specify the number of items to buy/sell per transaction.
- **LINE 3:** Price. Specify the price per transaction. Use 'B' for BUY and 'S' for SELL.
- **LINE 4:** Item. Identify the item to buy/sell. Use /iteminfo if unsure. Use '?' for autofill based on the chest contents. If the chest is empty, click the sign displaying '?' with the item in hand.

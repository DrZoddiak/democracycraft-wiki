# Mob Eggs

Fishermen, Farmers, and Mercenaries have the ability to capture certain mobs using eggs. These eggs can be then be sold in stores or to other players, providing an additional source of income.

## How to Use

To use this feature, simply throw a chicken egg at a mob. It will automatically deduct a $50 fee for a successful capture and provide you with a spawn egg. Please note that the capture chance is 1/3, which is equivalent to 33%.

## Caveats

1. Spawner eggs won't work in Cities/Towns due to spawning restrictions.
2. Named, sheared, tamed, and baby mobs cannot be captured.
3. It's possible to steal mobs from regions with this plugin, but staff logs can help identify such actions.
4. Villagers won't be added to this plugin under any circumstances.

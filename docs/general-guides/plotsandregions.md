# Plots & Regions

DemocracyCraft utilizes Areashop for region management, often abbreviated as AS.

## Wild Region

Players can build freely in the wilderness, but some may desire protection for their bases. You can claim one region with a maximum of 4096 blocks for $10 per block. To claim a wild region at a cost of $10 per block, open a staff ticket using /ticket for wild claiming.

## Urban Regions

There are three main types of plots within Redmont:
1. Commercial - Identified by the c- or cbd- tags. Only commercial buildings like stores and apartments are allowed on these plots.
2. Residential - Marked with the r- tag. Only houses with up to three visible floors can be built on residential plots.
3. Skyscraper - Denoted by the s- tag. Skyscraper plots can only have skyscrapers and are not meant for industrial or residential use.

To find available plots in the city, look for reselling properties with the corresponding tags (e.g., c-000). Use /as info reselling to locate resold plots and use ``/gps start 'plot'`` to get to that location.

## Rental Regions

There are four main types of rental regions on the server:
1. Farm Plot - Located in the Farming Town of Willow, these special farm regions can be rented by players (up to two per person). Denoted by the f- tag, they can be rented from the Willow Train Station.
2. Apartment - Some commercial buildings offer rentable apartments with prices based on the number of days. These real-life durations provide an affordable option for new players seeking a city residence.
3. Shop/Market Stall - Rentable stores are available in some regions, such as Vestire Mall, allowing players to sell items without purchasing an entire plot.
4. Shulker Regions - Certain city and town locations have free or low-cost shulker regions with rental durations of 1-10 minutes. Intended for temporary use, such as accessing a shulker box or ender chest.

You may also encounter other, less popular rental regions. To check information about a rental region, use ``/as info region 'rental region name'``.

## Property Regulations

Upon purchasing or renting a property, you must adhere to specific regulations and laws. For owned plots, the Department of Construction and Transport (DCT) may issue eviction reports for building violations. Meanwhile, landlords may evict tenants who breach their rental agreements.

For further details, consult the [Rules & Laws](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/rules-laws.5/) and the [Plot Regulations](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/plot-regulations.17/) threads.

![Rules and Laws - Who enforces what?](/img/rules/Rules_and_Laws_Enforcement.png)
![Rules and Laws - Let's avoid Bystanders](/img/rules/Bystanders.png)

Moderation is an important aspect of keeping our server a welcome and inclusive environment for everyone to enjoy. Below, we've included some guidelines that apply on all DemocracyCraft platforms.

Staff maintain full discretion in their enforcement of rules and general moderation.

Feel free to ask questions on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/democracy) if you have any questions or concerns.

:::tip Respect the spirit of the rules
These rules are here to protect you - not for us to come after you!

You will never be punished for raising a concern regading rules, regardless of whether it is about yourself or others. 

Something may not be explicitly defined here, that doesn't necessary make it ok. If you have to consider whether it is allowed, ask!
:::

### 1. Respect
- Any form of harassment, including (but not limited to): racism, homophobia, sexism, antisemitism, stalking is not acceptable ever.
- Discussions about controversial topics such as real world politics and world religion are not permitted in public channels.
- You are not allowed to impersonate or mimic other players or Staff members.
- Tickets must be used for assistance purposes only.
  - Be truthful always. We rely on your honest recount alongside our evidence to keep our community safe.
  - Trying to lie or misrepresent facts **intentionally** may result in additional disciplinary actions.

- Lava casting and flooding are not allowed anywhere.
- You may not destroy, obstruct or otherwise cause physical disturbances on property that you do not own.

### 5. Lag Prevention
- Redstone clocks are not permitted in any builds.
- All farms must either be manual or **semi**-automatic and are required to have player interactions. 
- You must avoid using excessive tile entities (chests, hoppers, item frames) or regular entities (mobs) in builds and designated spaces.
  - Item frames must only be used to display **non-vanilla** items. This applies especially for ChestShops

### 6. Fair Play
- Permissions must be used strictly for the reasons you told you can have them for. 
  - Many Government jobs contain additional features or access. It is your responsibility to use them responsibly and only for appropriate reasons.
- You must not use x-ray. Any proceeds from x-ray will be confiscated.
- You are allowed to use client modifications from our [allowed list](https://wiki.democracycraft.net/policies/clientmodifications) **only**.
- Any methods to avoid being kicked for being away-from-keyboard that is not genuine gameplay is not allowed.
- Any form of exploitation is not permitted for any reason. 
  - This includes using bugs in server features.
- You can only play on this server with **one (1)** Minecraft account. Any activities that occur on this account are your responsibility

:::tip If your account is compromised, report it!
We will try to help you out, and keep the account banned until you regain access to it.
:::

:::info Punishments are not linear
Depending on the severity of rules breached, your remorse for actions and compliance with Staff will affect disciplinary action.

On the lower end you may simply be told not to repeat the behaviour again (verbal warning). On the higher end however, you may be deported (banished to the wilderness) or banned.

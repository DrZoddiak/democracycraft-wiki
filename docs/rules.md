## Introduction
Moderation is an important aspect of keeping our server a welcome and inclusive environment for everyone to enjoy. Below, we've included some guidelines that apply on all DemocracyCraft platforms.

Staff maintain full discretion in their enforcement of rules and general moderation.

:::tip Respect the spirit of the rules
These rules are here to protect you - not for us to come after you! Feel free to ask questions on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/democracy) if you have any questions or concerns.

You will never be punished for raising a concern regading rules, regardless of whether it is about yourself or others. 

Something may not be explicitly defined here, that doesn't necessary make it ok. If you have to consider whether it is allowed, ask!
:::

### 1. Respect
- Any form of harassment, including (but not limited to): racism, homophobia, sexism, anti-semetism, stalking is not acceptable ever.
- Discussions about controversial topics such as real world politics and world religion are not permitted in public channels.
- You are not allowed to impersonate or mimic other players or Staff members.
- Tickets must be used for assistance purposes only.
- Do not mix Staffing with in-game politics. 
  - Staff members play a role that is seperate to governance. 
  - You are not permitted to use the fact they have elevated permissions or conduct official duties for any political purposes.

### 2. Chat
- Please do not excessively repeat your messages, use capital letters or profanity in your messages.
- You are not permitted to communicate in **any** other languages than English in public channels.
- If your speech is altered by in-game drinks, you are not permitted to speak in public channels.
- You **must** use the #âž• | Create VC channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/democracy) when you are streaming or recording. 
  - Inform people who join your voice channel that you are recording.

### 3. Advertising
- Advertising must be kept to ``/ad`` in-game or appropriate advertisement channels on our main Discord server.
- You must not advertise for any reason in private messages.
- Discord servers or Minecraft servers that are not for the purposes of DemocracyCraft are not allowed to be advertised anywhere.

### 4. Properties
- You are not allowed to steal from any place or any person.
- You may not destroy, obstruct or otherwise cause physical disturbances on property that you do not own. Lava casting and flooding are also not permitted under this guideline.

:::danger This does not apply to the Wilderness
You are allowed to destroy anything which is **unclaimed** in the Wilderness. This rule however still applies to anything that is **claimed**.
:::

### 5. Lag Prevention
- Redstone clocks are not permitted in any builds.
- All farms must either be manual or **semi**-automatic and are required to have player interactions. 
- You must avoid using excessive tile entities (chests, hoppers, barrels) or regular entities (mobs) in builds and designated spaces.

### 6. Fair Play
- You can only play on this server with **one (1)** Minecraft account. Any activities that occur on this account are your responsibility

:::tip If your account is compromised, report it!
We will try to help you out, and keep the account banned until you regain access to it.
:::

- Permissions must be used strictly for the reasons you told you can have them for. 
  - Many Government jobs contain additional features or access. It is your responsibility to use them responsibly and only for appropriate reasons.
- You must not use x-ray. Any proceeds from x-ray will be confiscated.
- You are allowed to use client modifications from our [allowed list](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/client-modification.13587/) **only**.


:::info Punishments are not linear
Depending on the severity of rules breached, your remorse for actions and compliance with Staff will affect disciplinary action.

On the lower end you may simply be told not to repeat the behaviour again (verbal warning). On the higher end however, you may be deported (banished to the wilderness) or banned.

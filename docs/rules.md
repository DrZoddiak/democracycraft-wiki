## Introduction
Moderation is an important aspect of keeping our server a welcome and inclusive environment for everyone to enjoy. Below, we've included some guidelines that apply on all DemocracyCraft platforms.

:::tip Respect the spirit of the rules
These rules are here to protect you - not for us to come after you! Feel free to ask questions on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/democracy) if you have any questions or concerns.

You will never be punished for raising a concern regading rules, regardless of whether it iis about yourself or others.
:::

### 1. Respect
- Use common sense. Self explainatory. 
- Any form of harassment, including but not limited to: racism, homophobia, sexism, anti-semetism is not welcome ever.
- Discussions about controversial topics such as real world politics and world religion are not permitted in public channels.
- You are not allowed to name yourself or pretend to be Staff members or players. Intentionally similar names or reusing past usernames of players fall under this guideline.
- You **must** use the #âž• | Create VC channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/democracy) when you are streaming or recording. In addition to this, you must inform people who join your voice channel that you are recording.
- You may not destroy, obstruct or otherwise cause physical distances on property that you do not own. Lava casting and flooding are also not permitted under this guideline.

:::danger This does not apply to the Wilderness
You are allowed to destroy anything **unclaimed** in the Wilderness
:::
- You are not allowed to steal **anywhere**. Should chests even be unlocked that is not permissable.
- Tickets are not to be used to murder Staff members.

### Chat
- If your speech is affected by in-game drinks, you must not speak in global channels.
- Please do not excessively repeat your messages, use capital letters or profanity in your messages.
- You are not permitted to communicate in **any** other languages than English in public channels.

### 3. Lag Prevention
- Redstone clocks are not permitted in any builds.
- All farms must either be manual or semi-automatic, and require interaction beyond flicking a lever.
- You must take care to not use excessive tile entities (chests, hoppers, barrels) or regular entities (mobs) in builds and designated spaces.

### 4. Fair Play
- You can only play on this server with **one (1)** account. Any activities that occur on this account are your responsibility

:::tip If your account is compromised, report it!
We will try to help you out, and keep the account banned until you regain access to it.
:::
- Do not mix Staffing with in-game politics. Staff members play a role that is seperate to governance, you are not permitted to use the fact of elevated permissions or official duties for political purposes.
- Advertising must be kept to /ad in-game or appropriate advertisement channels on our main Discord server.
- You must not advertise for any reason in private messages.
- Permissions must be used in accordance for why you were granted them. Government jobs often contain special perks, any misuse can result in revocation.

:::danger Punishments are not linear
Depending on the severity of rules breached, your remorse for actions and compliance with Staff will affect disciplinary action.

On the lower end you may simply be told not to repeat the behaviour again (verbal warned). On the higher end however, you may be deported (banished to the wilderness) or even banned.

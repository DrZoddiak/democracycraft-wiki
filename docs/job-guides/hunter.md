# Hunter Guide


## Introduction

As a Hunter, your job is to kill mobs--preferably in the wilderness--in exchange for money. Whether that be for casual food sources, such as farming cows, or killing zombies to defend yourself is up to you. However, you are still subject to the law and may not kill other players unless in the wilderness (even in this case, you will not get paid for the kill). You may also capture hostile mobs by throwing chicken eggs at them in order to obtain that mob's spawn egg for a price of $50!

## Information

Aside from simply walking around and killing things in the wild like Mojang intended, there are several other ways a Hunter may earn cash. Players with this job may maximize the amount of cash they receive by making manually operated or semi-automatic mob farms which allows that they both receive a steady income through kills and a consistent supply of that mob's drops which they may sell to any given business or even craft into other things to sell for a higher price point!

If you have the mindset to grind and the hunger for cold, hard cash then this is the job for you.

## Passed the Exam? Now What?

It is recommend that Hunters construct farms to bring in cash and sell those items either out of their own storefront or to a business owner! Below are a few guides to help you get started!

_Make sure to modify your build such that it does not break server rules by operating automatically._

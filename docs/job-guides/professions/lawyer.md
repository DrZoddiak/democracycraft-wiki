# Lawyer

As a Lawyer, your primary job is to consult players seeking legal advice, represent players in court, and marry couples.

The legal profession has three exams which must be taken in chronological order: Legal A > Legal B > Legal C.
- Legal A awards the solicitor title.
- Legal B awards the barrister title.
- Legal C awards the attorney title.

## What Lawyers Do

Lawyers in Redmont have several important roles:
- **Legal Advisors:** Players seek legal advice from lawyers, requiring you to provide guidance on legal matters.
- **Court Representatives:** You represent players in court cases, either as a defense attorney or a prosecutor.
- **Marriage Services:** Lawyers have the authority to marry two players, provided both parties consent. You can also handle divorce proceedings.
- **Exam Success:** To become a lawyer, you must pass three exams: Legal A, Legal B, and Legal C. These exams test your analytical skills, fact-finding abilities, and knowledge of legal terms. Outside research into legal matters and court proceedings on DemocracyCraft is necessary.

Commands:
- /marry ``playername`` ``playername`` - Marries two players.
- /marry divorce ``playername`` - Divorces two players.

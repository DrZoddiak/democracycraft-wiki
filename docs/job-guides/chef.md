# Chef Guide
PUT SOMETHING WHITTY HERE

## Introduction
Chefs are essential to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth as the producers of our food and the source of many farmers and companies income. As a Chef, you are tasked with taking crop items and converting them into new foods for players to consume.

## Information
While your job is to convert crop items into new foods for players to consume, you may do much more with this job in practice! For example, a chef may pair up with a brewer to create a restaurant which offers other beverage options alongside their meals, or may even supply their foods to another player's restaurant! If it isn't exactly your thing to get into the commercial sector, you may even set up a rental agreement to open up a food stand on someone's property! Get creative! The world is your oyster and it's your job to figure out how to cook it!

## Passed the exam? What now?
It is recommended, now that you have passed your exam, that you purchase or rent your own plot of land to open up your own business on. If this does not seem like something of interest to you, or if you cannot get land or cash, you may seek employment through DC Jobs using this link: [Join the DC Jobs Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/KBsatGF45q)

In order to open up your own business, however, you must have passed the entrepreneur exam in the University and must register your business with the DEC at [this link](https://discord.com/invite/KBsatGF45q)!

## How it works
To see all of the available items/recipes, do **/ia** in game.

There are ingredients you will need for each recipe, and sometimes you will need containers as well.

To see what you will need, pick a category: cooked food, deserts, beverages. If there is more than 1 page, you can click the arrow in the bottom right of the box.

Select the item you'd like to make to see what the recipe is for that item. If there are non-vanilla items in the recipe, you can click the item to see how to make it. To go back, click the red x. You can go on to more pages by clicking the blue arrows. You can search for an item using the magnifying glass on the home screen.

# Auditor

Auditors are responsible for delivering audit reports on government departments and towns. They assist the Secretary in the administration and auditing of intergovernmental affairs. Auditors receive a wage of $15 per 15 minutes and may earn commissions on audits.

## Duties

Auditors are responsible for completing audits, reports, censuses, and surveys at the discretion and direction of the department leadership. The role is a very work-at-your-own-pace type of role with limited direction and a lot of freedom in how you go about completing each assignment. Prospective auditors should have a high degree of autonomy and experience in government/business to demonstrate that they are suitable.

Although Auditors do have a large amount of individual autonomy, assignments and general direction are still administered by department leadership. Auditors can be assigned into teams or be given work individually. Assignments will generally include a scope and certain objectives to cover in addition to the "due date" for the assigned task.

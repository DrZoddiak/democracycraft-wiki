# Building Inspector

Building Inspectors are charged with maintaining the general aesthetic and activity of buildings in the city. These individuals will compile and post reports of those violating building and plot regulations.

Building Inspectors are commission-based pay.

## Duties

As a building inspector, your primary duty is to ensure that people are following the building regulations and laws in place. Your responsibilities include:
- Monitoring plots, players, and their builds.
- Documenting violations with notes and screenshots.
- Reporting on players who are not making significant progress or not building at all.

## Structure

The Department of Construction and Transportation is led by the Secretary who oversees the operations within the department. For the Building Inspector channels, the secretary is supported by the Inspection Manager, who is one of the two Deputy Secretaries. Day-to-day operations within the Building Inspector channels are managed by the Secretary and the Inspection Manager.

## Protocols

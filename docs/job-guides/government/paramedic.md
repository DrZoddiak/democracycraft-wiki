## Duties

**Answer EMT Calls**
- Citizens will use /emt to request a paramedic.
- Message the patient to determine their location (dynmap, buses, and using GPS-coords are acceptable too).
- Run /emtattend when answering an EMT call.
- Ask the patient how you may be of assistance and drive to the patient.
- If the patient is contagious, give them a soothing potion to slow their symptom progress and drive them to the hospital.

**Stock EMT Room**
- Ensure the EMT room has a good supply of bandages, leg splints, warm gel, and soothing potions.
- Craft supplies if stock is running low.

## Structure

**Secretary of Health:** Manages the department operations, creates and amends department policy. Works in determining Doctor of the Month.

**Deputy Secretary of Health:** Assists in the leadership of the department. Works in determining Doctor of the Month.

**Medical Specialist:** Responsible for general administration. Reports training records and evaluation records to Discord. Administers vaccines (currently unavailable), and attends patients.

**Paramedic:** Access to government-issued ambulance. Responds to EMT calls and transports patients to hospital. Is a doctor as well.

**Doctor:** The backbone of the department. Has had a successful evaluation. Attends patients.

**Trainee Doctor:** A doctor who has not completed their evaluation. Attends patients to gain experience.

## Protocols

- Be patient when communicating with players. Keep calm and empathetic.
- Honesty is the best policy. If you make a mistake, own up to it.
- Paramedics are doctors as well. Do not ignore doctor duties (attending patients in the hospital), as this may lead to termination.
- Be mindful of fellow EMTs. Do not take all the supplies in the EMT room for yourself.
- Do not use your ambulance for personal reasons. Keep it stocked with pharmaceuticals and within easy reach.
- Obey all traffic laws. You must drive carefully and park appropriately.
- Never abuse Paramedic commands in any way.
- Never purposefully drive the patient to a location other than the intended hospital/clinic.
- Communicate with fellow EMTs and other department members. Ask for help when you need it.
- The Secretary reserves the right to dismiss poorly performing members of the department.

Doctor protocols and rules apply. Please check out the [Doctor Guide](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/doctor-guide.1450/).

## RULES

- Paramedics should not lose their issued ambulance. Losing it will result in a fine equivalent to the price of the vehicle.
- Paramedics can store Leg Splints, Bandages, and Soothing Potions in the trunk of their ambulance to treat patients on-site.
  - They may also attend government or server events to handle emergencies there.
- Paramedics cannot use their ambulance for personal usage. Doing so will result in a warning the first time.
  - Doing so the second time will result in your Paramedic license + vehicle being revoked.
- If the patient does not have a contagious disease (such as Broken Legs or a Wound), you may treat them on location.
  - Never hand out free treatments.

5. Once you have reached the patient, you may give them a Soothing Potion if they have a contagious disease. Ask that they enter the ambulance.
6. Drive the ambulance back to the hospital - ensure you are following all traffic laws.
7. Once you have reached the hospital, direct the patient out of the ambulance into the hospital.

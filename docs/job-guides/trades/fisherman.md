# Fisherman

As a Fisherman, your job is to catch fish in exchange for money. Upon catching a fish, you will automatically be rewarded based on the rarity of your catch, everything from the most common Raw Cod to the rarest Tropical Fish!

## Information

You can fish in any body of water, whether it be natural or man-made. The only restriction is that you **CAN NOT** use an automatic or afk fishing machine.

If you enjoy fishing and you want to turn this into a way of living, then this job is for you!

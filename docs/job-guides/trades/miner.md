# Miner

As a Miner, your main role is to mine ores, such as coal and netherite, and sell them. You can create a business or supply ores to other players.

## What Miners Do

- Your primary task is mining various ores.
- To start a mining business, you need to pass the Entrepreneur qualification exam.

## Mining Made Easier

- You can speed up mining by purchasing a drilling vehicle from the Reveille Dealership (use /gps start revdealership).
- Klondike is a mining town where you can reside and mine, or you can mine in the wild.

## Getting Started After Passing the Exam

- Consider buying a plot and setting up a store to sell your products.
- Find available plots for sale/lease in the #realty-adverts section on our Discord.
- You can also sell to businesses using /find {item name} or find a shop with a minecart or enderchest.
- To gather resources, buy them from player shops or obtain them in the wild using /warp airport.

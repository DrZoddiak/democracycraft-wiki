# Miner

As a Miner, you are completely responsible for contributing to DemocracyCraftâ€™s mining industry by mining, and somehow selling, ores. With these ores you can either create a business in the industry or supply the playerbase will all things ore related.

## Information

As a miner your main job consists of mining ores, from coal to netherite and everything else in between. If you would like to pursue a business in the mining industry as mentioned before you must have the Entrepreneur qualification by passing the exam at the university.

If you would like to speed up the mining process a little bit and don't want to manually mine every ore, you can buy a drilling vehicle at the Reveille Dealership. To get there do /gps start revdealership.

There is a mining town called Klondike in which you can reside if you find it a perfect fit for you. If you want to you can also mine at Klondike as well as in the wild.

Mining is an amazing part of Democracy Craft and if this is your passion as well as having a potential entrepreneurial interest in turning that passion into a business, this is the job for you. As a server we wish you the very best in getting this job!

## Passed the Exam? Now What?
It's recommended that you purchase a plot and build a store, or rent a shop to sell your products in! Find available plots for sale/lease under #realty-adverts on our discord. You can also sell to businesses using /find {item name} and find a shop with either a minecart or enderchest. 

To gather resources, you can either buy them from player shops or obtain them yourself in the wild. To get to the wild, type /warp airport. Right click a monitor in the airport and choose out of 7 wild starting locations (pictured below).

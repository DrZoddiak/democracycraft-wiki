# Journalist Guide

As a Journalist, you are responsible for contributing to the serverâ€™s news industry. There are a variety of different kinds of journalism, and each one has its own niche audience and charm.


## Investigative Journalism

Investigative journalism involves thoroughly researching a topic to expose evidence and deliver findings of figures or organizations to a wider audience. Investigative journalists conduct in-depth research and use various tactics to collect information. After collecting and evaluating evidence, investigative journalists write comprehensive reports to expose the subject and provide evidence to support their conclusions.

This type of journalism often requires more time to plan, prepare and research, and is typically a longer form to fully report details of research, findings and conclusions. Investigative journalism can be both print and broadcast media. An example of investigative journalism includes researching businesses to determine whether they promote fair practices.

## Watchdog Journalism

Watchdog journalism is a genre intended to guard society against illegal activity or inefficiency from societal powers, such as corporations and politicians. It is similar to investigative journalism in that the intent is to uncover and expose wrongdoing. Watchdog journalists monitor the activities of large companies and influential figures and report activities that may have negative impacts on society. This type of journalism helps ensure societal powers remain accountable for their actions.

Watchdog journalism can be both print and broadcast media.

## Broadcast Journalism

Broadcast journalism reports information to the public through media such as YouTube. Branches of broadcast journalism include news and entertainment. Broadcast journalism can also take the form of investigative, watchdog and opinion types. Broadcast journalism can include reading the report without a corresponding video, narrating a report with a related video playing in the background or conducting a report in the field while capturing live video.

## Opinion Journalism

Opinion journalism reports on a topic using subjective ideas rather than objective facts. Opinion journalists report stories from their perspectives, including their thoughts and biases. Opinion journalism is unique from other types because the writer can include their viewpoint. It can be important to recognize the difference between opinions and facts. Opinion journalism is useful in helping people understand their own opinions and values as well as to develop a fuller picture of reality when consuming reports from multiple perspectives.

While some opinion journalists may align with your personal viewpoints, balancing those opinions with opposing perspectives is necessary to gain a deeper understanding and develop empathy and respect for diversity. An example of opinion journalism includes political journalists who report on political activity from their perspective.

## What Designers Do

As a Designer, your creative tasks are diverse and include:

### 1. Creative Pieces

You have the artistic prowess to craft breathtaking creative pieces that can range from traditional paintings to intricate pixel art. Your imagination is your only limit.

### 2. Business Advertisements

With your creative skills, you can develop eye-catching advertisements that businesses can use to promote their products or services. Your designs can play a vital role in attracting customers.

### 3. Political Advertisements

In the world of politics, your designs have the power to sway opinions and inform the masses. Create compelling political advertisements that convey important messages and campaign strategies.

### 4. Galleries

Designers also curate galleries to showcase their artistic masterpieces. These galleries are spaces where players and art enthusiasts can appreciate and enjoy your creative work.

## Dyes

Dive into a world of colors for your artwork by accessing the Dyes feature in the ArtMap GUI (/artmap).

This allows you to explore a wide variety of colors, with multiple pages of colors to choose from. You can view and select these colors while sitting at your easel and canvas.

## Tools

In the ArtMap GUI, you'll find various tools by clicking the Book and Quill. These tools include Bucket, Coal, Feather, and Compass, each serving a unique purpose.

### Paint Bucket

The paint bucket serves as a filler tool. Left-click to fill areas of the canvas with the dye in your offhand. To undo the last fill, simply right-click while holding the bucket.

### Coal

The coal tool enables you to adjust the brightness of pixels, giving you more shades of colors. It's useful for darkening a color once or twice. Hold the coal and right-click on a color to make it darker.

### Feather

The feather tool performs the opposite function of coal. Instead of darkening a color, it lightens it.

### Compass

The compass tool allows you to flip your art vertically or horizontally.

## Crafting

Before creating art, you must:

1. Craft an easel.
2. Craft a canvas.

Both are essential for making art, and their crafting recipes can be accessed via the command /artmap.

![Crafting Recipes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838356841217916989/1165580136532418600/1690550339855-png.png?ex=65475e17&is=6534e917&hm=6d48ee24864d31efa4ec4eb1ac476aa80b461cf68bfafe92164c99622c24bb65&)

## Painting

To start painting:

1. Place your easel.
2. Take a crafted canvas.
3. Right-click the easel to attach the canvas.

Now you're ready to paint! Right-click the easel to begin painting. You can use left-click for individual pixels and hold right-click to draw lines.

To take a break from painting, press the shift key to exit the easel, ensuring your art is saved for later.

## Saving Artwork

After creating your masterpiece, you can save it in two ways:

1. While sitting at your easel, type /art save [name].
2. Right-click your art with the paintbrush in your inventory.

For the second method, a GUI similar to an anvil interface will appear, allowing you to enter an artwork title and finalize it.

## Displaying Art

To display your art, place an item frame and right-click it while holding your art. It will appear as a picture.

You can make copies by combining blank maps and the original art in the crafting square. The number of blank maps used determines the number of copies you receive. Remember, only the owner of the art can create copies.

Be cautious about your inventory while creating art, as picking up items while sitting at the easel and standing up will destroy the item, rendering it irretrievable.

To view other players' art, use the command /artmap and access artworks. Click on player heads to explore their artwork.

# Contractor

What is a contractor? Simply put, a contractor is a person or company that undertakes a contract to provide materials or labor to perform a service or do a job. That means your job as a contractor in Redmont will be to take upon contracts to complete commercial buildings both small- and large-scale, redstone contraptions, mob farms, or to do anything in between that would require the labor of an individual other than the person paying for it.

## Information

In general, there are four sets of tasks a contractor may take upon based on who is providing the work. These include: (i) build; (ii) destroy; (iii) collect; and (iv) kill. While these four basic tasks will encompass the majority of work a contractor does, there is a wide variety of things to do within these basic tasks.

1. While you may be simply building, you may be tasked with building a variety of things: mob farms, redstone contraptions, commercial or residential structures, or even building up infrastructure for something such as a brewery within a commercial structure. At the end of the day, it all depends on the customerâ€™s needs.

2. Destruction is more than just taking down a structure, but could include more than just that: a player may need you to dig a trench or clear out space beneath their plot for a room, or may need you to tear down a single wall or floor of a structure. Ultimately, there are multiple kinds of destruction available for contractors to take part in and there is a kind of every person.

3. Collection may come in the form of farming crops, ores, stone, or anything else that the customer does not have the time or ability to get for themselves. A contractor may one day be farming wheat for one person and, the next day, collecting and smelting iron for another

4. Killing is not as gruesome or horrifying as it seems, but rather involves the slaying of mobs for their drops much in the way a mercenary would and is an extension of the act of collection. A contractor tasked with the collection of goods may also be tasked with getting said goods from a creeper farm and, as a result, would be collecting gunpowder through the killing of that mob.

Pay for contractors is up for negotiation between the contractor, or their company, and the client with it being recommended that a lawyer oversee the involved work contract to ensure legal soundness on all ends.

## How to Make Money

Contractors make money, as mentioned above, based on an agreement between the client and the contractor, or their company. There is no limitation to the amount of jobs a contractor may take on at once due to it being private industry work, as well. Accordingly, it is advised that contractors advertise on Discord in #business-adverts and in-game as often as possible, seeking out clients wherever possible.

A useful, and underutilized, resource which provides a great avenue for advertisement is DC Jobs which will also provide your company with a steady stream of employees you will be capable of taking in and training!

It is also encouraged that contractors make Discord servers for their companies such that people can maintain consistent contact with the contractor and may open up work orders at will, ensuring a steady flow of income and work!

## Passed the Exam? Now What?

It is recommended that you get the Entrepreneur guide and register a business on the Business Portal subforum or look for a company who is in need of one of the above accountant roles!

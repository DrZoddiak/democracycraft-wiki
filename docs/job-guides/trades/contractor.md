# Contractor

As a contractor in Redmont, your job is to take on contracts to provide materials or labor for various tasks, from building structures to collecting resources and more. Here's what you need to know:

## Contractor Tasks

In general, contractors perform four main types of tasks:

1. **Build:** You might be constructing buildings, redstone contraptions, farms, or infrastructure for businesses. Your work depends on the client's needs.

2. **Destroy:** This involves more than just demolishing structures; it can include tasks like digging trenches, clearing space, or removing parts of a building.

3. **Collect:** You may gather resources like crops, ores, or other materials for clients who lack the time or ability to do it themselves.

4. **Kill:** This task is about defeating mobs for their drops. You might be collecting materials from creatures like creepers.

## Getting Paid

Payment for your work is negotiated between you (or your company) and the client. It's a private industry, so you can take on multiple jobs simultaneously. To find clients and jobs, consider advertising on Discord in #business-adverts and in-game.

**DC Jobs** is a great resource for advertising and finding employees for your company. Consider creating a Discord server for your company to facilitate communication and work orders, ensuring a steady income.

## After Passing the Exam

If you've passed the exam, you may want to explore the Entrepreneur guide and consider registering a business on the Business Portal subforum. Alternatively, look for a company that needs your contractor skills.

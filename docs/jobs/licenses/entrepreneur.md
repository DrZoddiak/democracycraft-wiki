## Information
Note: ‘Entrepreneur’ is not a job. It is a qualification which you can get on top of having a regular job. Being an entrepreneur does not earn you government wages.

All entrepreneurs should first read the businesses guide to understand the basics of starting a business.

As a business owner, it is useful to know who is best for what job. For example, if you are looking for a wood supplier for your store, you may want to hire a lumberjack as their tree-feller perk can come in handy.

Anyone can start a business by setting up a chest shop, but only entrepreneur-qualified players have access to the command /ad.

**How to use /ad:**
Type your ad after /ad

For example:
/ad Come on down to the Cookie Store at [location name/coordinates], we sell cookies and more!

## Laws

To be a responsible driver and follow traffic laws, here are some key rules:

- Always drive on the right side of the road, and follow directional arrows if it's a single lane.
- Drive only within marked road areas to avoid careless driving fines.
- Never drive under the influence to prevent penalties.
- Park properly; improper parking may lead to vehicle impoundment.

## Acquiring a Car

Cars are valuable, so stealing one is against the rules. Visit the Vehicle Dealership near Essendon Train Station to buy one. Mechanics can craft cars, but it's costly. Consider buying from players or companies for a better deal.

## Using a Car

Only the owner can interact with the vehicle. Make sure you have enough space in your inventory. Here are the actions you can perform:

- Shift left-click: Refuel the vehicle.
- Shift right-click: Pick up the vehicle.
- Right-click: Get inside the vehicle.
- Right-click while in the vehicle: Open the trunk for storage.

## Fuel

Your vehicle needs fuel to run. Buy it from gas stations or craft it using 4 emeralds, 4 coal, and 1 bucket of water.

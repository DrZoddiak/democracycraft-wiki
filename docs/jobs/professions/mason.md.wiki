== What Masons Do ==

As a Mason, your primary role is to repurpose building materials and provide valuable services related to crafting and converting various stone and mineral-based items. Your responsibilities include:

* Converting crafted items made from andesite, diorite, granite, stone, prismarine, and more back into their original forms.
* Crafting specific items like coral blocks and gilded blackstone that are difficult to obtain through regular means.
* Reducing smelting times for materials such as glass, bricks, nether bricks, terracotta, and more when using blast furnaces, making crafting faster. (Note: you’ll receive fewer experience points for items smelted using this shortcut)

Whether you’re assisting with construction projects, breaking down materials for reuse, or improving crafting efficiency, Masons play a crucial role in the world of building and resource management.

== Information ==

Masons are valuable for those who need to create new things from existing materials, acting like building material alchemists in a sense. However, they can’t turn just anything back into its original form. Instead, they specialize in converting crafted items made from andesite, diorite, granite, stone, prismarine, and other materials listed below. But being a Mason is not just about conversions, as there are some unique crafting recipes and shortcuts available, too!

For instance, Masons can craft coral blocks from any type of coral, and even make gilded blackstone–two items that are difficult to obtain otherwise. Additionally, Masons enjoy reduced smelting times for a variety of materials such as glass, bricks, nether bricks, and terracotta when using blast furnaces, making crafting much faster than usual. However, keep in mind that you will receive less experience points for each item you smelt using the shortcut.

Whether you are into building, demolishing, or simply want to make crafting faster, the Mason job is an excellent choice. Check out the full list of materials a Mason can convert below!

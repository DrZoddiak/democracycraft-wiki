## Passed the Exam? Now What?
It is recommended that you purchase a plot and build a store, or rent a shop to sell your products in! Find available plots for sale/lease under #realty-adverts on our discord. As a Jeweller, you can also advertise your expertise in vehicles under #business-adverts.

To gather resources, you can either buy them from player shops or obtain them yourself in the wild. To get to the wild, type `/warp airport`. Right-click a monitor in the airport and choose out of 7 wild starting locations (pictured below).

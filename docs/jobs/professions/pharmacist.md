# Pharmacist

As a pharmacist, your role allows you to manufacture and sell pharmaceutical medical treatments to players privately. Unlike doctors, pharmacists do not receive a government paycheck.

## What Pharmacists Do

Pharmacists play a vital role in DemocracyCraft by providing essential medical treatments to players. Here's what pharmacists typically do:

- **Manufacture Cures**: Pharmacists craft various medical cures to treat common ailments such as broken legs, flesh wounds, and more. These cures are essential for players seeking medical assistance.

- **Sell Medical Goods**: Once the cures are crafted, pharmacists can sell them to players privately. This role helps ensure that players can access critical medical treatments outside the hospital setting.

- **Resource Gathering**: To create medical treatments, pharmacists need to gather resources, either by purchasing them from player shops or collecting them in the wild. 

## Information

- `/disease list`: Provides players with a list of diseases and their cures.

- `/health`: Allows players to check if they have a disease. Normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius.

- Temperature: Check the patient's temperature. Normal temperature is 37. Higher is hot, lower is cold. Advise patients accordingly: 
  - Hot: Remove armor or stay in a cold environment like water.
  - Cold: Put on armor, seek shelter, or stand near a fire.

Pharmacists can set their own prices and sell medical goods in bulk, making this job suitable for crafting medicinal products and helping other players outside the hospital.

## What to Do After Passing the Exam

Once you've passed the exam, consider purchasing a plot and building a store or renting a shop to sell your products. You can find available plots for sale or lease in the `#realty-adverts` section on our Discord server. Alternatively, you can look for companies to work with through DC Jobs:

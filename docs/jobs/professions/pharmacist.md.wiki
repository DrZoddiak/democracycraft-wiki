== What Pharmacists Do ==

Pharmacists play a vital role in DemocracyCraft by providing essential medical treatments to players. Here’s what pharmacists typically do:

* '''Manufacture Cures''': Pharmacists craft various medical cures to treat common ailments such as broken legs, flesh wounds, and more. These cures are essential for players seeking medical assistance.
* '''Sell Medical Goods''': Once the cures are crafted, pharmacists can sell them to players privately. This role helps ensure that players can access critical medical treatments outside the hospital setting.
* '''Resource Gathering''': To create medical treatments, pharmacists need to gather resources, either by purchasing them from player shops or collecting them in the wild.

== Information ==

* <code>/disease list</code>: Provides players with a list of diseases and their cures. [[File:https://i.imgur.com/qPJINqa.png|Disease List]]
* <code>/health</code>: Allows players to check if they have a disease. Normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. [[File:https://i.imgur.com/nb2bkVO.png|Health Check]]
* Temperature: Check the patient’s temperature. Normal temperature is 37. Higher is hot, lower is cold. Advise patients accordingly:
** Hot: Remove armor or stay in a cold environment like water.
** Cold: Put on armor, seek shelter, or stand near a fire.

Pharmacists can set their own prices and sell medical goods in bulk, making this job suitable for crafting medicinal products and helping other players outside the hospital.

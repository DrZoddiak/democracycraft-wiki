## What Mechanics Do

Mechanics are skilled crafters responsible for building vehicles. Below are the recipes for a few different kinds of the many vehicles, which can be sold through various means that comply with server rules and regulations.

## Passed the Exam? What Now?

After becoming a mechanic, it is recommended to purchase a plot and build a store or rent a shop to sell your products. You can find available plots for sale or lease under #realty-adverts on our Discord. Mechanics can also advertise their expertise in vehicles under #business-adverts.

To gather resources, you can either buy them from player shops or obtain them in the wild. To access the wild, type `/warp airport`, right-click a monitor in the airport, and choose from one of the six wild starting locations.

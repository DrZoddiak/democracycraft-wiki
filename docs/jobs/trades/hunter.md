# Hunter

As a Hunter, your main responsibility is to eliminate mobs, preferably in the wilderness, in exchange for payment. You can choose to hunt for food, like cows, or defend yourself against zombies. But remember, you must follow the law and avoid harming other players, unless you're in the wilderness (and even then, you won't get paid for player kills). Hunters also have the unique ability to capture hostile mobs using chicken eggs, allowing them to obtain spawn eggs for a fee of $50!

## What Hunters Do

Beyond simply wandering the wilderness and hunting mobs as intended by Mojang, Hunters have various ways to earn money. They can create manual or semi-automatic mob farms to secure a steady income from kills and a constant supply of mob drops, which they can sell to businesses or craft into valuable items to fetch higher prices.

If you're determined, willing to grind, and motivated by a desire for substantial earnings, this job might be an excellent fit for you.

After passing the exam, it's recommended that Hunters set up farms to generate income and sell the resulting items either in their own stores or to business owners. Here are some guides to help you get started:

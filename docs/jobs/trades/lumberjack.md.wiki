== What Lumberjacks Do ==

Being a Lumberjack isn’t just about cutting trees like any other player. You have an exclusive ability known as the “Tree Feller.” With a simple left-click, you can bring down entire trees at once. This special skill sets you apart from regular players and makes wood harvesting easier and more efficient.

While anyone can sell logs, only Lumberjacks have the advantage of the Tree Feller ability, giving them a competitive edge in the industry.

If you enjoy collecting wood and want to excel at it, this job might be perfect for you. We hope you can obtain this role and that it enhances your tree-related endeavors.

== Passed the Exam? What Now? ==

After passing the exam, it’s recommended to purchase a plot or rent a shop to sell your wood products. You can find available plots in the #realty-adverts section on our Discord. Additionally, you can sell your wood to businesses using the <code>/find {item name}</code> command to locate shops with minecarts or enderchests.

To gather resources, you can either buy them from player shops or obtain them in the wild. Access the wild by typing /warp airport and select one of the seven starting locations. (See the picture below).

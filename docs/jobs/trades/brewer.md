# Brewer 

As a brewer, you're able to brew a variety of elixrs throughout the server, you can sell these throughout the community and help support the roleplay element of the server, along with being able to have a fun time.

## What Brewers Do
Brewers craft elixrs on the server, this takes time, and patience along with skill to get it right. 

## Getting Set Up
To craft elixirs in DemocracyCraft, you need to set up the following:

**Book of Brews**
The Book of Brews contains all the recipes a brewer could need, to craft this item you need the following: 8 Empty Glass Bottles, and 1 Book. To craft this you must put the book in the center of a crafting table and suround it with the glass bottles, to be able to see the recipes you must be a brewer.

**Brewing Cauldron** - This is used to ferment your ingredients into a mash, the initial step in elixir crafting. First, place a cauldron over a fire source, like a lit netherrack or campfire, one block above the flame, as shown below. Then, put a bucket of water inside to enable brewing three elixirs per cauldron.

**Brewing Stand** - Some recipes require distilling. To do this, place glowstone dust in the top slot of a brewing stand and put the elixir bottles inside to distill.

**Wood Planks** - Some recipes require barrel aging to complete the elixir crafting process. There are two types of aging barrels available: small barrels with 9 slots are easy to store in your home or shop. Large barrels, on the other hand, can hold up to 27 elixirs and are constructed using various types of wood. They occupy more space, and each year of aging corresponds to 20 minutes in real time, which is also a full Minecraft day. Here's how to make each type of barrel:

**Small Barrel (9 Slots + Always Considered Oak)**
1. Use 8 wooden stairs to construct the barrel.
2. Attach a sign to the lower right stair with "Barrel" written on the first line.

**Big Barrel (27 Slots)**
1. Use 1 fence, 16 wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape, as shown below.
2. Attach a fence to the bottom and a sign with "Barrel" on the first line at the top.

**Sealing Table** - This ensures that the elixir can no longer be modified through additional aging or distilling. It adds brackets around the star quality and hides specific details about the elixir, displaying only its quality, barrel aging status, and distillation.

To craft a sealing table is simple! you simply take 4 planks of any kind, and 2 bottles and arrange them like a smithing table (with the bottles replacing the iron in the recipe)

**Fermenting**
- Once you have your ingredients ready, proceed to the cauldron. Make sure to have the right quantity!, then right click on the cauldron holding your ingredients and wait for the time to pass!

## Tip: You can use a clock in-game to see how many minutes your brew has been fermenting!

**Distillation**
- To initiate the distillation, set up a brewing stand with a single piece of glowstone dust at the top slot. Place the elixir bottles in the brewing stand and wait for the distillation to complete.
- Distillation is complete when the elixir reaches the required number of distillation runs, and it will automatically stop.


**Aging**
- After distillation, check if the recipe specifies aging. For the Mystic Elixir, it requires 15 years of aging in oak wood barrels. As previously mentioned, 1 year of aging equals 20 minutes of real-time, so 15 years correspond to 5 hours.
- Place the elixirs in the aging barrel. Right-click to open the barrel, and place the elixir bottles inside. After a few minutes, the year information will appear when you hover over the bottles.
- Once the elixirs have aged for the required duration, they will reach a 5-star quality and be ready for sealing. If any of the steps (Ingredients, Distillation, Aging) are displayed in orange or red, it indicates an error in that step, resulting in lower elixir quality.

**Sealing**
- When you're ready to package and sell your elixirs, use the Sealing Table. You can place up to 9 elixirs at a time in the table, and each one will be sealed within a few seconds.

# Brewer 

Learn the art of crafting elixirs through the processes of brewing, distilling, and barrel aging here on DemocracyCraft. Discover how you can transform basic ingredients into powerful elixirs. We have custom elixir recipes, and new elixirs are consistently added. While crafting elixirs can be a challenging endeavor, it offers the potential for substantial rewards. By the end of this guide, you'll have a deep understanding of the elixir craft.

## What Brewers Do
Crafting elixirs is an exciting pursuit, but it's not for everyone. It demands time, patience, and effort to transform raw ingredients into high-quality elixirs. You'll find that our elixirs are inspired by real-world recipes, with authentic properties and production methods. Every elixir craft can specialize in the type of elixirs they want to produce and sell, whether it's traditional elixirs, mystical potions, or special brews.

## Getting Set Up
To craft elixirs in DemocracyCraft, you need to set up the following:

**Brewing Cauldron** - This is used to ferment your ingredients into a mash, the initial step in elixir crafting. First, place a cauldron over a fire source, like a lit netherrack or campfire, one block above the flame, as shown below. Then, put a bucket of water inside to enable brewing three elixirs per cauldron.

**Brewing Stand** - Some recipes require distilling. To do this, place glowstone dust in the top slot of a brewing stand and put the elixir bottles inside to distill.

![Brewing Stand](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838356841217916989/1170361733102194840/TBJxOi8OeW1UC_ZlGImSmW3gnbW1X0i0yTBcyJ2u02x_P2M0C53HU6Wqch0OH3yKtJQbyV_K6e_80Y_h_-ZI8alIHKGbs2hYZFAJfjIeP3rzvKDaEydOOu2xsDuse89Ys0JcM5rsiZq-yvjwwBQIEr8.png?ex=6558c34d&is=65464e4d&hm=f8a2c77028b23908a7c2fa4ce26a267803c0efaf88d8922b5e5f795d83a9e65b&)

**Wood Planks** - Some recipes require barrel aging to complete the elixir crafting process. There are two types of aging barrels available: small barrels with 9 slots are easy to store in your home or shop. Large barrels, on the other hand, can hold up to 27 elixirs and are constructed using various types of wood. They occupy more space, and each year of aging corresponds to 20 minutes in real time (i.e., 4 in-game years equal 1 hour and 20 minutes in real time). Here's how to make each type of barrel:

**Small Barrel (9 Slots + Always Considered Oak)**
1. Use 8 wooden stairs to construct the barrel as shown below.
2. Attach a sign to the lower right stair with "Barrel" written on the first line.

![Small Barrel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838356841217916989/1170361750554681344/W491vIgYrlKI7vJAuvSmjdC8CFSw9HKeP3sk5HE_Hv7NLUBA45cJ9UALQrdtyuur5bIWNWRB9HWz_1Z6DDdhVY4Zwzg9nIwsKKSMXzBI_ItCvsbbFlo4QqI7baJM4S_yBX0_BZ4w5vA6wvs1_bcOfA8.png?ex=6558c351&is=65464e51&hm=fa1c6f682f957eba27f84e85151bf171585c1abde86a101a7ddd9da725c98bb3&)

**Big Barrel (27 Slots)**
1. Use 5 fences, 16 wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape, as shown below.
2. Attach a fence to the bottom and a sign with "Barrel" on the first line at the top.

![Big Barrel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838356841217916989/1170361773803704462/vOY2bv4B8QthTpo-WZSKytsgh8rVO83wsNjDZK2NafZEU0YZ1LNHVL6BWLBCNEZkdySuwUlwcCF0CXy0kxwYMzEatGh2CmhAlblMhivdcSseMQsfUAoVsRS1Ughrgtu0HObmetsZRFWAG_EuLse8kQI.png?ex=6558c357&is=65464e57&hm=64e70ca694ec0e616ae74379fd4f798a6be10f6e27f20d08e25c4855d1c0c91b&)

**Sealing Table** - This ensures that the elixir can no longer be modified through additional aging or distilling. It adds brackets around the star quality and hides specific details about the elixir, displaying only its quality, barrel aging status, and distillation.

![Sealing Table](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838356841217916989/1170361783077314610/uEZCXNJG9p0pc63Ek0q2cJvRHhrmUC6ctOL_pucQpWHQsU3pd4RrMH_R3qG3CEYnzf6dDAGgAi3HPYugQ7gt2CxqPyawA3lxiuGAzEaH34_DdOTcyecDf5fAXNgdkE7yYQT33-5JElS_eiXsl9R1-00.png?ex=6558c359&is=65464e59&hm=f89a2e1bb95632ee22f38a43a7209a478429823f9d226fb821193fc486bae042&)

**Fermenting**
- Once you have your ingredients ready, proceed to the cauldron. This recipe has a single ingredient, which makes it easier to follow. When a recipe includes multiple ingredients, add the second one only after the first is fully added. For the Mystic Elixir, you'll need 12 Essence of Magic.

![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/838356841217916989/1170361805994987540/L2cApk2pkveVVQjrTKQytwiX5V6Vk5sH9YfXYHs8_T5b6FtvI9m4EJttCP6ofyq6HOkoXzG5RnnkM4WMQ2rD5FBTEDkqCmCFhe3jkPfpkfCr519DOXDlH2UscyCzpgA__mA7BeKkRyNhWbPI5BF7ylQ.png?ex=6558c35e&is=65464e5e&hm=86a3a51d3a8aafb3495e8586e5367b92fab8aa379277d9f577c021ff3d0da01c&=&width=720&height=405)

**Distillation**
- To initiate the distillation, set up a brewing stand with a single piece of glowstone dust at the top slot. Place the elixir bottles in the brewing stand and wait for the distillation to complete.
- Distillation is complete when the elixir reaches the required number of distillation runs, and it will automatically stop.

![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/838356841217916989/1170361899389550602/grGZhOXPorFKfM0uVziFHfnfQ-XOb5SOougEJICkleoMzs2Juq85z46OerK0lzkfB-E_7vXmAMkJCyda5UI-_flSyxspqrkPUFu7jRZ9NDJYtQYTxdV-2eeICTK-e0NGIx8vbuTeHPhgNgLHZicNJNw.png?ex=6558c375&is=65464e75&hm=135be0dbcfc44f3ee40b7586ef284da4ff20fd2c304c948044031797fe3c32fe&=&width=720&height=405)

**Aging**
- After distillation, check if the recipe specifies aging. For the Mystic Elixir, it requires 15 years of aging in oak wood barrels. As previously mentioned, 1 year of aging equals 20 minutes of real-time, so 15 years correspond to 5 hours.
- Place the elixirs in the aging barrel. In this guide, we're using a large barrel. Right-click to open the barrel, and place the elixir bottles inside. After a few minutes, the year information will appear when you hover over the bottles.
- Once the elixirs have aged for the required duration, they will reach a 5-star quality and be ready for sealing. If any of the steps (Ingredients, Distillation, Aging) are displayed in orange or red, it indicates an error in that step, resulting in lower elixir quality.

**Sealing**
- When you're ready to package and sell your elixirs, use the Sealing Table. You can place up to 9 elixirs at a time in the table, and each one will be sealed within a few seconds.

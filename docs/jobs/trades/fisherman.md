## What Fishermen Do

You can fish in any body of water, whether it's natural or man-made, to make a living. However, there is one rule: you cannot use automatic or afk fishing machines. 

If you find relaxation in fishing and aspire to turn it into a livelihood, this job might be the perfect choice for you!

## What Contractors Do

Contractors typically perform four main types of tasks:

### 1. Build

Your skills in construction might be put to use in various ways, including constructing buildings, redstone contraptions, farms, or essential infrastructure for businesses. Your work will be determined by the specific needs of your clients.

### 2. Destroy

The "destroy" task entails more than just demolishing structures. It can include activities like digging trenches, clearing land, or removing sections of a building to prepare it for a new purpose.

### 3. Collect

As a contractor, you might find yourself gathering resources such as crops, ores, or other materials for clients who lack the time or expertise to do so themselves. Your resource-gathering capabilities can be invaluable.

### 4. Kill

The "kill" task involves hunting and defeating mobs to obtain valuable drops. You may be tasked with collecting materials from creatures like creepers or other hostile mobs.

## Getting Paid

The compensation for your work as a contractor is typically negotiated directly between you (or your company) and the client. This industry is private, allowing you to take on multiple jobs simultaneously. To discover potential clients and job opportunities, consider promoting your services on the official Discord server in the #business-adverts channel and within the game.

Utilizing **DC Jobs** can be a valuable resource for both advertising your services and finding potential employees for your company. Creating a dedicated Discord server for your company can streamline communication and work orders, ensuring a steady flow of income.

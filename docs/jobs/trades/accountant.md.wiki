== What Accountants Do ==

'''Recordkeeping:''' Your first job is to keep a record of all the money-related stuff using things like invoices and receipts. Think of it like taking notes in a diary. This makes everything organized and easy to understand.

'''Summarizing:''' Then, you take all those notes and turn them into simple reports. Imagine making a summary of a big book. These reports show how the city is doing financially. Some important reports are like the city’s bank balance, income, and expenses.

'''Financial Detective:''' Next, you become a bit of a detective. You look at those reports and figure out what’s going well and what’s not. This helps the city make smart decisions. You can also compare our city to others to see how we’re doing.

'''Explainer:''' Lastly, you explain all this financial stuff to people who need to know. This could be helping them understand how the city is doing, what might happen soon, or where to invest money. This helps everyone make smart choices based on the city’s money.

<span id="keeping-the-books"></span>
== Keeping the Books ==

In finance, we use something called double-entry bookkeeping. It’s like a fancy way to keep track of the city’s money. Here’s the basic idea:

* We have five types of accounts: stuff we own (assets), what we owe (liabilities), how much the owner invested (owner’s equity), money from selling things (revenue), and the cost of running the city (expenses).
* We use two main actions: debits and credits. Debits are like a positive change; they increase assets and expenses but decrease liabilities, owner’s equity, and revenue. Credits are the opposite.
* We write down all the money actions in journals, making sure we use debits and credits correctly. Each journal entry needs at least one debit and one credit, and they should balance out.
* After that, we put the journal entries into the general ledger, which is like a big book with all our accounts and how much money is in them.
* We also use a trial balance to make sure everything is correct and balanced. This is important to keep our financial records tidy.

The goal of all this bookkeeping is to create financial statements that show how the city is doing financially. These statements help everyone make good decisions about how to run the city.

<span id="the-accounting-cycle"></span>
== The Accounting Cycle ==

The accounting cycle is just a fancy term for how we keep our financial records in order. It has a few steps:

# '''Record Everything:''' We write down every money thing that happens in the city. This is like keeping a journal.
# '''Put it in the Ledger:''' After we record everything, we put it in the ledger, which is like a big book with all our accounts and how much money is in them.
# '''Check the Balance:''' We make sure everything adds up correctly by doing something called a trial balance. It’s like counting all your money to make sure it’s all there.
# '''Adjustments:''' Sometimes, we need to make changes to our records, like when we have bills to pay or money we’re waiting to get. We add these changes to our records.
# '''Final Statements:''' After making all the changes, we create financial statements. These statements tell us how the city is doing with its money. They’re like the city’s report card.
# '''Start Over:''' We reset everything for the next period. This makes sure our records are always up to date.

<span id="financial-statements"></span>
== Financial Statements ==

Financial statements are like the city’s financial report card. They show how much money we have, how much we owe, and if we’re making a profit. There are four main ones:

# '''Balance Sheet:''' This is like a snapshot of the city’s money at a specific time. It tells us what we own (assets), what we owe (liabilities), and what’s left for the owner (owner’s equity).
# '''Income Statement:''' It’s like a money diary for a specific time, usually a few months or a year. It tells us how much money we made and how much we spent. The difference is our profit (or loss).
# '''Statement of Owner’s Equity:''' This statement keeps track of changes in the owner’s investment in the city. It tells us if the owner’s investment is growing or shrinking.
# '''Cash Flow Statement:''' This is like a money GPS. It tells us where the money is coming from and where it’s going. It helps us see if we’re managing our money well.

<span id="accrual-vs-cash-accounting"></span>
== Accrual vs Cash Accounting ==

There are two ways to keep track of money:

'''Accrual Accounting:''' This method records money when it’s earned or spent, even if we haven’t received or paid it yet. It shows a more detailed picture of the city’s finances.

'''Cash Accounting:''' This method only records money when it actually comes in or goes out. It’s simpler but may not show the full financial picture because it doesn’t consider money we’re owed or owe.

<span id="management-accounting"></span>
== Management Accounting ==

This is all about helping the city make good financial decisions. Some important things to do:

* '''Budgeting:''' Make a plan for how the city will spend its money for the year.
* '''Variance Analysis:''' Compare what we planned to spend with what we actually spent to see if we need to make changes.
* '''Cost Allocation:''' Figure out how much it really costs to do different things in the city. This helps us make good decisions about what to do and how much to charge.
* '''Profitability Analysis:''' See which parts of the city make the most money. This helps us use our resources better.
* '''Costing Methods:''' Use different ways to figure out how much things cost. It depends on what we need the information for.
* '''Performance Evaluation:''' Check how well different parts of the city are doing and if they’re meeting our goals.

<span id="financial-analysis"></span>
== Financial Analysis ==

This is like looking at the city’s money health. We use special math (ratios) to see how well we’re doing. Here are some examples:

* '''Liquidity Ratios:''' These tell us if the city can pay its bills quickly. It’s like checking if we have enough cash on hand.
* '''Solvency Ratios:''' These show if the city can pay its long-term
* '''Profitability ratios''' look at a company’s ability to make profits compared to its sales, assets, or equity. These ratios help us see how well a company is doing financially and if it can make returns for shareholders.

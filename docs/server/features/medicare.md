# Medicare

Citizens of Redmont are privileged to have access to a high-class healthcare system. Medicare is a Government scheme funded by taxpayers to provide premium standard healthcare to everyone and anyone who decides to take a small exam to qualify.

**What is covered:**
- All disease-related treatments

**What is not covered:**
- Pharmacy goods
- Ambulance rides

## How Does This Work?

Each time you are treated (excluding pharmacy goods) by a Government doctor in the Hospital, instead of paying through your own balance via `/pay`, you are entitled to be covered by using Medicare. Instead of running `/pay`, you run `/medicarepay` and provide the doctor's username and click on what disease you were treated for. This way, your treatment is covered by the Government and alleviates medical expenses that you may have.

To obtain Medicare, go to the Government Hospital and click the Exam sign for Medicare in the front reception. This is a 5-question short test that will make sure you know how the system works.

## Commands

`/medicarepay username` - Opens up the GUI for Medicare.

Replace 'username' with the username of the Doctor who has treated you and then click on what disease you were treated for. The Doctor, as per usual, will always ask that you pay **before you receive** the treatment.

**Abuse of this command will result in warnings, fines, and possible termination of your Medicare depending on discretion from the Department of Health.**

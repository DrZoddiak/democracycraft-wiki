## Getting Married

- **Find a Lawyer.** In Redmont, to get married, you just need to talk to a lawyer. A lawyer will make sure everything is super legal and officiate the union for you. They'll help you understand what papers and things you need to have the best wedding ever.

- **Pick a Nice Place.** Once everything is set with your lawyer, it's time to pick a fun place for your wedding! Redmont has so many cool spots, and you get to choose where you want to say, 'I do.'

:::note Finding a Lawyer

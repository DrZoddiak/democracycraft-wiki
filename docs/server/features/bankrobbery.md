## Robbing the Bank

Players can attempt to rob the bank only when a police officer is online. To break into the vault, you should enter the bank and navigate through maze-like corridor)s to locate gold blocks. Breaking these blocks will reward you with a random sum of money but will also trigger an alarm, alerting all online police officers.

The bank resets automatically every six hours after each robbery. However, this information isn't tracked to prevent players from exploiting the reset timing.

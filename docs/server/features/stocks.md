## What Are Shares?

Shares represent units of ownership within a company. When you purchase shares from a company, you become an investor and a partial owner. As the value of the company increases, so do the value of your shares.

Typically, the principle of "buy low" and "sell high" applies when trading shares. Players often invest in companies when share prices are low and sell them when they rise.

Selling shares to players enables companies to grow and develop new industries. For example, a company wanting to expand but lacking funds might list itself on a private stock exchange to raise capital. This infusion of money allows the company to expand, making both the company and its shares more valuable.

## Investing

Players can invest in private stock exchanges by joining their Discord servers. The procedures for buying and selling stocks may vary. Keep in mind:
- Rules and regulations for stock markets may vary.
- Your investment isn't guaranteed a return if the company ceases to exist.
- Selling shares back to the exchange may not always be possible.

Additionally, some private stock exchanges may impose transfer fees or activity limits.

## Companies and Crypto

On stock exchanges, players often encounter two types of units to buy: shares in companies or cryptocurrencies. When considering shares in companies, think about:
- The reputation of the owner and management of the company.
- The company's financial performance.
- Company plans and facilities.
- The demand for the company's product or service.

For cryptocurrencies, consider:
- The reputation of the cryptocurrency's owner and management.
- Trends in the cryptocurrency's value.
- The versatility of the cryptocurrency across platforms.

Both options carry risks, so careful consideration is essential to avoid losing your investment over time.

Investing in private stock exchanges offers opportunities to become part-owner of companies and cryptocurrencies, but it's crucial to understand the risks and carefully evaluate your options.

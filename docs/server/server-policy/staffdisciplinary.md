# Staff Disciplinary System

If a staff member has been punished under the staff disciplinary system (SDS), they will not be punished under the server rules for the same breach. The staff disciplinary system takes precedence.

## Staff Values

The Staff team operates on four values:

**Service** - The selflessness of character to place the interests of our server and its players ahead of your own (Activity, Ticket Counts, etc).

**Integrity** - The consistency of character to align your thoughts, words, and actions to do what is right (Honesty and Moral Strength).

**Respect** - The humanity of character to value others and treat them with dignity (Engagements).

**Excellence** - The willingness of character to strive each day to be the best you can be, both in a staff context and personally (Going above and beyond).

## Coaching

Coaching is an informal process which is not recorded. Coaching is provided to staff members who make minor mistakes by their staff mentor or other more senior staff members. The aim of coaching is to prevent the behaviour from happening again by discussing what went wrong and how it could be dealt with differently next time.

## Warning

Warnings are a formal process which is recorded in the Staff member's channel. Warnings are provided to staff members who continue to repeat behaviours after coaching or who have made errors in judgement. All warnings are tied to a Staff Value(s).

## Notice to Show Cause (NTSC)

A NTSC is a formal process which is recorded in the Staff member's channel. A NTSC is provided to staff members who have received an unreasonable amount of warnings, or for continued warnings based on the same behaviours. A NTSC may also be issued to staff who have made significant errors in judgement.

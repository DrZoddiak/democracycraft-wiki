# Welcome
This is a brief introduction to this week's changelog. It should not be any longer than 2-3 sentences, it should be upbeat and introductory. Use your own words, there isn't any set format for this.

## Features
- **Important bit** of the change
  - Sub bullet point. 2 max of these.

# Summary
Another three sentences, keep it brief. You can say whatever you want (within reason).

</pre>
* I used “- None.” as an example, of when you have nothing to say.
* You don’t need to include images at all, but at a max, have three reasonably sized images.
* '''If you are creating a blog post for the first time''', you need to be added as an author to the blog. Ask Technofied or Nacholebraa for this to be done for you!
** Either one of them will provide you with your name, to replace <code>yourname</code>.

The intent of this post is to be brief and informative! :)

<span id="thats-all-folks"></span>
== That’s all, folks! ==

Good job on making it this far. :)

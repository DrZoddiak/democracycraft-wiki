</div>
Welcome to the DemocracyCraft Staff Guide! This guide contains all staffing policies, tips, and tricks that is used in day-to-day operations. By making this guide public access, our playerbase is informed of the expectations and procedures our Staff are subjected to.

If you are a new hire, first off - congratulations! We’re excited to have you onboard with us. Seeing the table of contents/how long this document is may appear scary at first, but try to remember we don’t expect you to memorise everything. We give you this guide so you know where to refer to when you need help, in addition to your peers.

With enough time, you might end up contributing to this guide!

<span id="staff-wide-policies"></span>
== Staff-wide Policies ==

These are policies every Staff member should be familiar with!

<span id="career-progression-and-disciplinary"></span>
=== Career Progression and Disciplinary ===

The purpose of this guide is to provide information on how staff are selected and how staff members progress in their careers. This guide also provides guidance on staff-specific disciplinary actions.

<span id="values"></span>
==== Values ====

The Staff team operates on four core values

<span id="service"></span>
===== Service =====

The selflessness of character to place the interests of our server and its players ahead of your own (Activity, Ticket Counts, etc).

<span id="integrity"></span>
===== Integrity =====

The consistency of character to align your thoughts, words, and actions to do what is right (Honesty and Moral Strength).

<span id="respect"></span>
===== Respect =====

The humanity of character to value others and treat them with dignity (Engagements).

<span id="excellence"></span>
===== Excellence =====

The willingness of character to strive each day to be the best you can be, both in a staff context and personally (Going above and beyond).

<span id="progression"></span>
==== Progression ====

Staff progression is determined by a series of factors such as, but not limited to: - Activity - Character - Competence - Suitability for promotion - Engagement with the Server and it’s community - Adherence to Staff Values and Expectations

<span id="what-staff-progression-is-not-determined-by"></span>
===== What staff progression is not determined by =====

* Your political or business affiliations, spicy or not.
* Your friendship with other staff members. Your rapport, however, will be considered.
* Whether you simp for, or are politically aligned to, End or Tech.

<span id="who-determines-your-progression-to-these-ranks"></span>
===== Who determines your progression to these ranks =====

* '''All''': Your mentor will advise in if and when you are promoted.
* '''Senior Administrator''': Server Leadership
* '''Administrator''': Senior Staff
* '''Moderator''': Administration Team+
* '''Trial Moderator''': Administration Team+

<span id="how-does-it-work"></span>
===== How does it work? =====

# A member of the team, generally a senior staff member, will raise a nomination for discussion.
# A discussion is had about the member’s suitability and other defining factors.
# The nomination is put to vote. Generally no comments are provided by the poster of the vote in the vote channel itself in order to maintain neutrality.
# An outcome is reached over time or after further discussion.

<span id="staff-disciplinary-system"></span>
=== Staff Disciplinary System ===

If a staff member has been punished under the staff disciplinary system (SDS), they will not be punished under the server rules for the same breach. The staff disciplinary system takes precedence.

<span id="coaching"></span>
==== Coaching ====

Coaching is an informal process which is not recorded. Coaching is provided to staff members who make minor mistakes by their staff mentor or other more senior staff members. The aim of coaching is to prevent the behaviour from happening again by discussing what went wrong and how it could be dealt with differently next time.

<span id="warning"></span>
==== Warning ====

Warnings are a formal process which is recorded in the Staff member’s channel. Warnings are provided to staff members who continue to repeat behaviours after coaching or who have made errors in judgement. All warnings are tied to a Staff Value(s).

<span id="notice-to-show-cause-ntsc"></span>
===== Notice to Show Cause (NTSC) =====

A NTSC is a formal process which is recorded in the Staff member’s channel. A NTSC is provided to staff members who have received an unreasonable amount of warnings, or for continued warnings based on the same behaviours. A NTSC may also be issued to staff who have made significant errors in judgement.

<span id="duties-and-expectations"></span>
=== Duties and Expectations ===

Our Staff have several day-to-day roles that are covered under specific titles. Below is a table that comprises of typical duties and who is responsible for each duty.

As you progress up the ranks, you are expected to maintain your prior level’s duties while taking on the added duties. A focus is given to being able to help the server with your extended privilages.

<span id="values-1"></span>
==== Values ====

These are a set of principles that guide us as a team. - '''Service''' - The selflessness of character to place the interests of our server and its players ahead of your own - e.g. activity, ticket counts, etc. - '''Integrity''' - The consistency of character to align your thoughts, words, and actions to do what is right - This refers to being truthful, and your moral strength - '''Respect''' - The humanity of character to value others and treat them with - This refers to how you engage with others - '''Excellence''' - The willingness of character to strive each day to be the best you can be, both in a staff context and personally - This is what is often referred to as ‘going above and beyond’!

<span id="expectations"></span>
==== Expectations ====

* As a staff member you have access to certain staff-related information. This should not be shared with anyone outside of the staff team. Respect player confidentiality.
* Be integral. Don’t steal. Don’t lie.
* We all make mistakes and we learn through them. Don’t try and cover them up, it doesn’t help anyone!
* If you aren’t sure, ask your fellow staff members!
* Approach tickets in a timely, friendly, and helpful manner.
* Respect and value the advice of staff that are senior to you.
* Staff permissions are used for tickets while assisting other players only.
* Be positive! - Smile :)

<span id="for-managers"></span>
== For Managers ==

<span id="panel-access"></span>
=== Panel Access ===

Managers are responsible for adding Senior Administrators and Administrators to our server control panel. To add a user, follow the steps below. 1. Open the <code>DemocracyCraft</code> server. 2. Navigate to <code>Users</code> and click <code>New User</code>. 3. Enter the Staff member’s email address, and select <code>Manage</code> under <code>Subdomain</code>. This is a temporary permission. 4. You will now notice a new user entry, on the right hand side next to the bin click on <code>Import user permissions</code>. 5. Grab the list of permissions in the next section below, that corresponds to the Staff member’s rank in the team. 6. Paste it in the input box, and click <code>Import</code>. 7. Repeat Steps 2-6 after opening the <code>DemocracyCraft Playground</code> server. 8. Great work! All done. :)

<div class="tip">

Remind the Staff member that all activities are logged, and that we have a mandatory two factor authentication requirement!

== For Senior Administrators ==

<span id="console"></span>
=== Console ===

As a Senior Administrator, you are able to access both the server console and files. To be added to the panel, direct message on Discord either owners to recieve your invitation! You will mainly be using this to configure plugins, fix bugs, and add new features.

<div class="tip">

There is no one set way of learning how to do these things. Trial and error, along with observation goes a great deal in helping you form your own way of doing these things.


</div>
Be sure to log any player-facing changes in #changelog, and any internal changes in #internal-changelog. This way we have an accurate record of who’s done what!

<span id="for-system-administrators"></span>
== For System Administrators ==

<span id="resetting-the-nether-and-end"></span>
=== Resetting the Nether and End ===

In most instances, a Nether and End reset will occur once every 6 months, typically during our quiet hours. This time frame tends to be 10pm EST - 5am EST is the optimal time for this reset.

<span id="steps"></span>
==== Steps ====

# Try to make an announcement in #server-announcements one week away for the desired data.

* Make a follow up announcement at least 48 hours before the reset as well to give players a reminder that this is about to happen!

<span id="how-to-manage-billboards"></span>
=== How to manage Billboards ===

We use a plugin called ImageMaps to allow us to implement images in-game via item frames. This plugin is currently how we’re able to make billboards!

<span id="steps-1"></span>
==== Steps ====

# Upload your image to an image hosting service such as [http://imgur.com/ Imgur] or [https://imgbb.com/ ImgBB]
# Download the image in-game by running <code>/imagemap download &lt;filename&gt; &lt;sourceURL&gt;</code>

* Replace <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> with an easy to identify name, without any file extensions such as <code>.png</code>.
* Replace <code>&lt;sourceurl&gt;</code> with a link to the image, this '''should include''' the file extension such as <code>.png</code>.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Place the image in-game by running <code>/imagemap place &lt;filename&gt; [frameInvisible] [frameFixed] [frameGlowing] [size]</code></li></ol>

* Replace <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> with the file name you selected in Step 2. Please add the file extension featured in the <code>&lt;sourceurl&gt;</code> you used earlier.
* Replace <code>[frameInvisible]</code> with “true”, no quotation marks. This ensures that players do not see the default item frame texture in empty spaces of the image.
* Replace <code>[frameFixed]</code> with “true”, no quotation marks. This ensures a clean removal of the image by punching the item frames in creative.
* Replace <code>[frameGlowing]</code> with “false”, no quotation marks. This the frames are not glowing.
* Replace <code>[size]</code> the height (A) and width (A) in the following format: AxB
** i.e. for a 2 by 2 image, it would be: <code>2x2</code>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Admire your work! [[File:/img/staffing/google_imagemap_example.png|Google Logo]]</li></ol>

<span id="understanding-your-forums-privilages"></span>
=== Understanding your Forums Privilages ===

As an administrator you have access to our forums control panel. Here you can update user roles and profiles, as well as manage various forum functionality.

You can login to the control panel with the same credentials you use for the forums [https://www.democracycraft.net/admin.php here]

<span id="user-confidentiality"></span>
==== User Confidentiality ====

You will have access to more information than a regular player. This information is in confidence and as always, we have a zero tolerance approach to privacy breaches.

<span id="user-role-management"></span>
==== User Role Management ====

<div class="warning">

'''Never''' update a user’s primary group. It should always be <code>Registered</code>.


</div>
When updating groups, all you should be modifying are <code>Secondary Groups</code>. Do not modify regular Department or otherwise automated roles.

[[File:/img/staffing/registered_group.png|Registered Primary Group]] Staff changes require two separate roles and one option: <code>Show as Staff</code>, <code>Staff</code>, and <code>Moderator/Administrator/Senior Administrator</code>. [[File:/img/staffing/secondary_group.png|Secondary Groups]]

<span id="broken-role-syncing"></span>
==== Broken Role Syncing ====

When a player’s roles are not syncing properly, these are the three simple steps you do to fix this. 1. Remove all their Secondary Group Roles (excluding Staff roles!) 2. Ask them to log in, wait a few seconds and then log out 3. Ask them to log back in after 2-3 seconds

If their roles don’t sync back up - please ask them to log in for 2-3 minutes instead before logging out.

<span id="how-to-conduct-rollbacks"></span>
=== How to conduct Rollbacks ===

We use the industry standard plugin CoreProtect to log all of our in-game interactions. This allows us to rollback, inspect, and review any player changes or interactions as they happen.

<span id="commands"></span>
==== Commands ====

* <code>/co help</code> - help command; displays all commands.
* <code>/co rb; /co rollback</code> - rollback block data based on certain parameters.
** '''Usage:''' <code>/co rb u:&lt;user&gt; t:&lt;time&gt; r:&lt;radius&gt; a:&lt;action&gt; b:&lt;blocks&gt; e:&lt;exclude&gt;</code>
* <code>/co undo</code> - revert a rollback.

You can see a list of parameters for these commands [[#coreprotect-parameters|here]].

<span id="additional-information"></span>
==== Additional Information ====

Here is a [https://youtu.be/JwijCiueZ3Y video tutorial] that goes other aspects of CoreProtect that are not covered within this guide.

<span id="how-to-manage-vpn-bypasses"></span>
=== How to manage VPN Bypasses ===

Players will commonly open tickets suffering connection issues. There are multiple ways we can attempt to solve this, but before anything else get them to turn their router off and back on. This is often the simplest solution.

<span id="for-windows"></span>
==== '''For Windows''' ====

<span id="flushing-dns"></span>
===== Flushing DNS =====

# Navigate to the desktop.
# Right-click the Start button.
# Choose Command Prompt.
# When asked whether to allow Command Prompt to make changes to your computer, select Yes.
# Type <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> and press Enter. You’ll receive a message when your DNS has been cleared.

Flushing the cache removes all the information stored in the cache, forcing the computer to find new DNS information. This will not harm your computer.

<span id="changing-dns"></span>
===== Changing DNS =====

# Click on the Start menu, then click on Control Panel.
# Click on Network and Internet.
# Click on Change Adapter Settings.
# Right click on the Wi-Fi network you are connected to, then click Properties.
# Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (or Version 6 if desired).
# Click Properties.
# Write down any existing DNS server entries for future reference.
# Click <code>Use The Following DNS Server Addresses</code>.
# Replace those addresses with the <code>1.1.1.1</code> DNS addresses:
# For '''IPv4''': <code>1.1.1.1</code> and <code>1.0.0.1</code>
# For '''IPv6''': <code>2606:4700:4700::1111</code> and <code>2606:4700:4700::1001</code>
# Click OK, then Close.
# Restart your browser.

<span id="vpn"></span>
==== VPN ====

If all fails, this could be a routing issue that cannot be solved through conventional means. Asking the player to use a free Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as [https://cloudflarewarp.com Cloudflare Warp].

If you offer this option, please provide the player with the <code>antivpn.bypass</code> permission node in-game.

<span id="administrative-commands"></span>
=== Administrative Commands ===

These are useful commands to know with your position.

<span id="luckperms"></span>
==== LuckPerms ====

* <code>/lp; /luckperms; /perm; /perms: /permissions</code> - Main alias. Put these before any LuckPerms command.
* <code>/lp editor [type]</code> - Opens a website interface to edit permissions data. After changes are saved, a command will be given that you need to run for the changes to take effect.
** <code>[type]</code> - the types to include in the editor session. can be <code>all</code>, <code>users</code> or <code>groups</code>.

<span id="user-commands"></span>
===== User Commands =====

* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; info</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; permission</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; parent</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; meta</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; editor</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; promote &lt;track&gt; [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; demote &lt;track&gt; [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; showtracks</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; clear [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; clone &lt;user&gt;</code>

<div class="tip">

Add in-game roles via <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; parent add &lt;job&gt;</code>


</div>
<span id="group-commands"></span>
===== Group Commands =====

* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; info</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; permission</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; parent</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; meta</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; editor</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; listmembers [page]</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; setweight &lt;weight&gt;</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; setdisplayname &lt;name&gt;</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; showtracks</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; clear [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; rename &lt;new name&gt;</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; clone &lt;name of clone&gt;</code>

<span id="general"></span>
===== General =====

* <code>/tps</code>- check the ticks-per-second (tps). The go to command to check for server lag. <code>/whois</code> - useful for finding a players IP if you wish to ban their IP.
* <code>/socialspy</code> - able to see players private messages.

<span id="crates"></span>
===== Crates =====

* <code>/crates give &lt;user&gt; &lt;crate&gt;</code> - sometimes it’s easier to give these to yourself and then transfer them to the player’s inventory. This is for a couple of reasons:
** It won’t work if the player’s inventory is full.
** It requires the player to be online.

<span id="for-moderators"></span>
== For Moderators ==

Here is everything a Moderator needs to know!

<span id="managing-players"></span>
=== Managing Players ===

Players are tricky business but shouldn’t be feared - after all you are one! Here are some guides on scenarios and managing behaviour.

<span id="how-to-check-for-alternative-accounts"></span>
==== How to check for Alternative Accounts ====

Players are only allowed one account on our discord, forums, and in-game. This is for a few reasons; mainly for ease of identification and punishment as well as for economic reasons in game.

Players who join and show as alternative accounts should be alternative accounts tested.

<div class="info">

Players who have alternative accounts will receive all of the punishments associated on their main account. The alternative accounts should be banned.


</div>
<span id="assessing"></span>
===== Assessing =====

When someone first joins the server, our punishments plugin automatically runs a check on them (manually you can do <code>/alts &lt;username&gt;</code>). This scans their account to see if there are any other accounts that are playing on the same IP as them.

<div class="figure">

[[File:/img/staffing/flagged_alt_account_examples.png|Alternative Accounts Flagged Example]]

</div>
Once you do <code>/alts</code>, something like this will come up. If there are two or more green usernames (which means that they are both online at the same time), check <code>#relations</code> on discord to see if someone has already done an alternative accounts test on them. If no one has, then you need to conduct one.

If you run <code>/alts</code> on someone and they have one green username and one or more grey usernames, that means that an account with the same IP has logged on before. Check <code>#relations</code> to see if they have passed the alternative accounts test before. If they haven’t, make a note in <code>#relations</code>.

You can also check both accounts’ command histories by running <code>/co lookup</code> on them. If one account has transferred all of its money to the other account, it is pretty safe to say that they are alternative accounts.

<span id="testing"></span>
===== Testing =====

If both accounts are online you can first try conducting the movement test.

# You can warp yourself and them to the alts testing area using <code>/warp alts &lt;player&gt;</code>.
# Once both players are there, inform them that their accounts have been flagged as suspicious and that you need to conduct an alternative accounts test on them.
# Ask one player to run on the pink line and the other on the blue line.
# You then look to verify that both accounts are making independent movements from one another (they are both moving at the same time).

If they fail the test in one of these listed ways, you’re allowed to ban one of the accounts permanently for having alt accounts; 1. One of the players is not moving or moving every so often 2. Only one player moves at a time 3. One is uncooperative with the test (not responding to anything) 4. One or both accounts log off and do not return after a while.

However, if the players pass, you can run <code>/staff-notanalt &lt;username 1&gt; &lt;username 2&gt;</code> and it will remove the warning and add a message in <code>#notes</code>.

Additionally, you could go into <code>/spectator</code> and <code>/staff-tp</code> to them to further investigate/watch their movements to verify that they aren’t alts.

<span id="understanding-basics"></span>
=== Understanding Basics ===

<span id="worldguard"></span>
==== WorldGuard ====

* <code>/rg define &lt;name&gt;</code> - Creates a region.
* <code>/rg remove &lt;region&gt;</code> - Removes the specified region.
* <code>/rg redefine &lt;name&gt;</code> - Re-sets an existing region to your current selection.
* <code>/rg setparent &lt;region&gt; &lt;parent&gt;</code> - Sets the specified region to be a child of the second given region. Used for when creating apartment regions.
** Ex.: <code>/rg setparent ExampleRegion dc-001</code> - Sets dc-001 as the parent of region ExampleRegion

==== WorldEdit ====

We use WorldEdit as a tool for many staff duties and staff duties only. Seen staff members rolling around with a wooden axe? Yep, that’s a WorldEdit wand.

We use WorldEdit to make selections for regioning, vaulting, and assisting players in most instances, Abuse of this plugin is strictly not tolerated. You can find a practical course on the Staff Training warp to help with this guide.

It may seem like a lot to learn at first, however it’s quite straight forward after a bit of time and experience.

<span id="getting-started"></span>
===== Getting Started =====

<span id="making-a-selection"></span>
====== Making a selection ======

A cuboid is like 3D rectangle. In WorldEdit, you select the region that you want by setting two points of a cuboid. In the next example, the first point is the top right corner of the cuboid and the second point is the bottom left corner of the cuboid.

<div class="figure">

[[File:https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/_images/cuboid.png|World Edit Cuboid Visualization]]

</div>
<span id="how-do-you-choose-the-two-points-you-can"></span>
====== How do you choose the two points? You can… ======

* Left and right click blocks while holding a wooden axe (use <code>//wand</code> to get a wooden axe)
* Stand somewhere and enter <code>//pos1</code> and <code>//pos2</code>
* Look at a block and enter <code>//hpos1</code> and <code>//hpos2</code>

<span id="commands-1"></span>
===== Commands =====

* <code>//wand</code> - gives you a World Edit tool.Left click a block while holding it to make your first selectionRight click a block while holding it to make your second selection
* <code>//wandoff</code> - takes away a World Edit tool from your inventory.
* <code>//cut</code> - copies and clears your current selection.
* <code>//paste</code> - pastes your previous cut selection.
* <code>//expand &lt;amount&gt; [direction]</code> - makes your current selection expand by the amount specified in the specified direction.
** Amount is either specfified as a number or <code>vert</code> (infinitely vertical).
* <code>//calc</code> - short for ‘calculate’. Allows you to do equations in-game. Example: <code>//calc 100*7</code>
* <code>//sel [poly/cuboid]</code> - select the type of region.
** <code>Cuboid</code> is the '''default''' selection type; basic two point selection
** Left click a block to set first selection
** Right click a block to set a second selection.
** Poly is the '''advanced''' selection type.
** Left click a block to set first selection
** Right click a block to set a second, third, fourth, etc. selection
* <code>//sel</code> - when used like this this command will clear your current selection.
* <code>//rotate &lt;degrees&gt;</code> - rotates your current clipboard (cut/copy) the specified degrees.
** Degrees have to be in multiples of 90 or it won’t work.
** i.e. <code>90</code>, <code>180</code>, <code>270</code>, <code>360</code>, <code>-90</code>, <code>-180</code>, <code>-270</code>, <code>-360</code>.
* <code>//move &lt;amount of blocks&gt; [direction]</code> - moves your current selection by the amount specified in the specified direction.
* <code>/expand &lt;number&gt; [direction]</code> - modifies your selection in the direction specified by the amount of blocks specific.

<span id="directions-can-be"></span>
====== Directions can be… ======

* '''Relative to the world'''
** i.e. <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>north</code>, <code>east</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>west</code>.
* '''Relative to the player'''
** i.e. <code>forward</code>, <code>back</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code>.

If a direction is ommited from the command, the region will expand in the direction the player is looking.

'''Examples:''' - <code>//expand 6</code> - Expand 6 blocks in the direction you’re facing - <code>//expand 10 up</code> - Expand 10 blocks upwards - <code>//expand vert</code> - Expand the region selection from bedrock to the sky. Do '''not''' use when making rentable regions (i.e. apartment rooms)

<span id="areashop"></span>
==== AreaShop ====

AreaShop is essentially a real estate plugin for world guard regions, allowing us to sell and rent them. You’re now able to sell and unrent regions owned by other players - This is used for when evicting players from a region.

This is a general guide - moderators should refer to the more specific guides on regioning.

[[#urban-regioning|Learn more about Apartments/Shops regioning]]

[[#wild-regioning|Learn more about Wilderness regioning]]

<span id="commands-2"></span>
===== Commands =====

* <code>/as add &lt;buy/sell&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code> - makes a region either a buyable or rentable region.
** Used when making wilderness or apartment/shop regions.

<div class="warning">

You must specify the shop/apartment’s region name when maing it rentable, otherwise you run the risk of making the parent plot rentable instead!


</div>
* <code>/as del &lt;region&gt;</code> - deletes the specified region from AreaShop.

<span id="how-tos"></span>
=== How-tos ===

<span id="managing-disputes"></span>
==== Managing disputes ====

As a staff member you will sometimes be required to handle delicate situations. We run on a few principles to assist staff making decisions in these scenarios.

<span id="solve-problems-as-early-as-possible-at-the-lowest-level"></span>
===== Solve problems as early as possible at the lowest level =====

Unfortunately arguments and disputes are not like wine and don’t get better over time. They get worse.

It’s really important for all parties that we jump on any situation early and solve the problem pacifically.

<span id="steer-clear-of-drama"></span>
===== Steer clear of drama =====

Some players have a tendency to incite drama and you will come to learn who they are quite quickly. Be compassionate but keep a mind on players’ motives.

Usually, what happens out of the server and its’ server related channels isn’t for us to deal with unless it’s quite serious and relates to our platforms. i.e. bullying enabled by our Discord server.

<span id="evidence"></span>
===== Evidence =====

Sometimes players can get a little invested or tell white lies (i.e. not telling you the whole story where they may have also been at fault) when presenting to you with a report.

Make sure you collect evidence to support claims, regardless of the amount of people wanting a player banned for example.

<span id="there-are-two-sides-to-every-story"></span>
===== There are two sides to every story =====

There will always be a personal bias in every story. Person A’s story will always be slightly different from Person B’s story.

It’s important that you assess both sides to come up with an educated guestimate of the truth which is usually somewhere between the two stories.

<span id="searching-for-items"></span>
==== Searching for Items ====

We use Coreprotect to log all of block interactions. This allows us to lookup certain interactions.

<span id="commands-3"></span>
===== Commands =====

* <code>/co l; /co lookup</code> - used to lookup specific block data.
* <code>/co l u:&lt;user&gt; t:&lt;time&gt; r:&lt;radius&gt; a:&lt;action&gt; b:&lt;blocks&gt; e:&lt;exclude&gt;</code>

<span id="parameters"></span>
=== <a id="coreprotect-parameters"></a>Parameters ===

These can be used in almost every CoreProtect command.

<span id="uuser"></span>
==== <code>u:&lt;user&gt;</code> ====

* Specify a user to rollback. Example: u:Technofied

<span id="ttime"></span>
==== <code>t:&lt;time&gt;</code> ====

Specify the amount of time to rollback. You can specify weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

'''Example:''' t:2w,5d,7h,2m,10s

You can pick and choose time amounts. '''Example:''' t:5d2h

You can also use decimals '''Example:''' t:2.50h (2 and a half hours)

<span id="rradius"></span>
==== <code>r:&lt;radius&gt;</code> ====

Specify a radius. You can use this to only rollback blocks near you.

You can specify a number (i.e. <code>r:5</code>), a world (i.e. <code>r:#world_the_end</code>), a global rollback (<code>r:#global</code>), or a WorldEdit selection (<code>r:#worldedit</code> or <code>r:#we</code>)

For example, the following would only rollback damage within 10 blocks of where you are standing: <code>r:10</code>

<span id="aaction"></span>
==== <code>a:&lt;action&gt;</code> ====

Restrict the rollback to a certain action.

'''Example:''' If you wanted to only rollback blocks placed, you would use <code>a:+block</code>.

'''Here’s a list of all the actions:''' - <code>a:block</code> - blocks placed/broken - <code>a:+block</code> - blocks placed - <code>a:-block</code> - blocks broken - <code>a:chat</code> - messages sent in chat - <code>a:click</code> - player interactions - <code>a:command</code> - commands used - <code>a:container</code> - items taken from or put in chests - <code>a:+container</code> - items put in chests - <code>a:-container</code> - items taken from chests - <code>a:inventory</code> - items dropped or picked up by players - <code>a:+inventory</code> - items picked up by players - <code>a:-inventory</code> - items dropped by players - <code>a:item</code> - items dropped, picked up, taken from, or put in chests - <code>a:+item</code> - items picked up or put in chests - <code>a:-item</code> - items dropped or taken from chests - <code>a:kill</code> - mobs/animals killed - <code>a:session</code> - player logins/logouts - <code>a:+session</code> - player logins - <code>a:-session</code> - player logouts - <code>a:sign</code> - messages written on signs - <code>a:username</code> - username changes

<span id="bblocks"></span>
==== <code>b:&lt;blocks&gt;</code> ====

Restrict the rollback to certain block types. For example, if you wanted to only rollback stone, you would use b:1 You can specify multiple items, such as b:1,5,7

<span id="eexclude---exclude-certain-block-types-from-the-rollback."></span>
==== <code>e:&lt;exclude&gt;</code> - Exclude certain block types from the rollback. ====

'''Example:''' If you don’t want TNT to come back during a rollback, you would type e:46

<span id="hashtag---add-a-hashtag-to-the-end-of-your-command-to-perform-additional-actions."></span>
==== <code>#&lt;hashtag&gt;</code> - Add a hashtag to the end of your command to perform additional actions. ====

'''Example:''' To perform a rollback preview, you would use <code>#preview</code>

'''Here’s a list of available hashtags:''' - <code>#preview</code> - preview a rollback/restore - <code>#verbose</code> - display additional information during a rollback/restore - <code>#silent</code> - display minimal information during a rollback/restore

<span id="merging-regions"></span>
==== Merging regions ====

Players may merge certain regions to allow for larger plots, provided that they own two or more neighbouring regions.

A common Sistake in staffing is regions being deleted during merges.

<div class="danger">

To merge a plot correctly, no regions should be deleted, both to save us time when unmerging and to preserve the plot numbering system.


</div>
To achieve this the following command ought to be used <code>/rg redefine &lt;plot&gt;</code>

<span id="merging"></span>
===== Merging =====

To merge a region is quite simple - all that is required is to redefine a region over the plot divider. See below for an example.

<div class="figure">

[[File:/img/staffing/merge_regions_example.png|Merging Example Image]]

</div>
<span id="what-can-be-merged"></span>
===== What can be merged? =====

You can merge any commercial and industrial plots.

Residential, CBD, and any other special plots are '''NOT''' to be merged.

<span id="urban-regioning"></span>
==== <a id="urban-regioning"></a> Urban Regioning ====

Urban regions are city/town plots and their child regions (apartments/shops).

This guide will show you how to create child regions. For this, you will be using World Edit (selecting the region), World Guard (making the region), and Areashop (renting the region).

<div class="danger">

* Child regions may only be created on Commercial and Industrial plots, not residential and are rent only. You '''cannot''' have rent regions within rent regions.


</div>
<span id="step-by-step-guide"></span>
===== Step by Step Guide =====

* '''1.1 Creating the WorldGuard region and fining the player.'''
** After selecting the points for the region you can define the region to create it.
** The owner of the building may choose the name of the region.
** '''Command:''' <code>/rg define &lt;regionName&gt;</code>.
*** i.e. <code>/rg define EndStore1</code>.
* '''1.2 Make sure to fine the player for the creation of each region.'''
** Each region costs $25 to create excluding shulker regions, those are free.
** '''Command:''' <code>/fine &lt;user&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code>.
*** Select “Staff” as the account to send the fine to.
*** i.e. <code>/fine xEndeavour 25</code>.
* '''2.0 Setting the region parent.'''
** Next we need to tell WorldGuard who the child region belongs to. In order to do this, we will parent the child region to the plot it’s on.
** The parent is the plot the room will inherit permissions from.
** Setting the room’s parent will allow the plot owner and any other members of the plot to modify within the rooms.
** '''Command:''' <code>/rg parent &lt;regionName&gt; &lt;PlotRegion&gt;</code>.
*** i.e. <code>/rg parent EndStore1 c001</code>.
* '''3.0 Adding the region to AreaShop'''
* After you have created the WorldGuard region and parented it, it’s now time to make it rentable. All you need to do is add the region to Areashop.
** '''Command:''' <code>/as add rent &lt;regionName&gt;.</code>
* '''3.1 Set the landlord'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setlandlord &lt;landlord&gt; &lt;regionName&gt;</code>, this usually is the player who is creating the region.
* '''3.2 Set the price'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setprice &lt;price&gt; &lt;regionName&gt;</code>
* '''3.3 Set the duration'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setduration &lt;duration&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code>
* '''4.0 Adding an AreaShop sign'''
** If the player is unable to provide a sign for you to place and create, you can obtain one by using <code>/staff-getsign</code>.
** After you get a sign, you can place it somewhere outside of the door/front of the region where any player can access.
** The player will usually show you where they want the signs.
** After the sign is placed look at it and use the command: <code>/as setsign &lt;regionName&gt;</code>, this will make the sign interactive and add the region’s information to it.
* '''5.0 Quality Checks'''

Check the priority of the region is 30 or above via <code>/rg info &lt;regionName&gt;</code> - if not click on the priority and type in 30.

Make sure to get rid of the wool that you placed, don’t leave anything behind.

<span id="using-the-sign-based-method"></span>
===== Using the sign-based method =====

If you prefer doing region creation through signs, try [https://github.com/NLthijs48/AreaShop/wiki/Basic-regions-setup#rental-region this]!

<span id="wild-regioning"></span>
==== <a id="wild-regioning"></a> Wild Regioning ====

Wilderness regions are private wild plots that any players can obtain.

It costs $10/block to claim land in the wilderness.

:::danger Please note the following: - Players may only have '''one''' wild region up to '''4096 blocks''' in their wild region, and unless given permission, your region needs to be at least 20 blocks away from another player’s region.

:::

<span id="step-by-step-guide-1"></span>
===== Step By Step Guide =====

* '''1.0 Getting the price for the region'''
** To get the price, you’re going to use your wand to select two corners but make sure they are on the same height (y level).
** This will give you the total number of blocks within your selection
** After this, multiply the total block number by 10 to get the price.
** '''Command:'''<code>//calc &lt;totalblocks&gt;*10</code>

<div class="figure">

[[File:/img/staffing/wild_price_calculation_example.png|Wild region price calculation example]]

</div>
* '''2.0 Seeing if the player can afford it'''
** After getting the total price of the land, check the player’s balance to see if they can afford it.
** Command: <code>/bal &lt;player&gt;</code>
** '''If they have enough money''', tell them the price and ask if it’s okay.
** '''If they don’t have enough money''', let them know, maybe they’ll have money in their companies. Otherwise, offer to resize the selection.
* '''3.0 Creating the WorldGuard region'''
** Now that we have the region selected and we know the player can afford it, it’s time to define the region.
** '''Command:''' <code>/rg define &lt;playerName&gt;</code>
*** i.e. <code>/rg define Technofied</code>

<div class="danger">

All wild regions should have the same naming convention: <code>&lt;playerName&gt;</code>


</div>
* '''4.0 Adding the region to AreaShop'''
** After you’ve created the WorldGuard region, it’s now time to make it buyable.
** '''4.1 Add the region'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as add buy &lt;regionName&gt;</code>
** '''4.2 Set the landlord'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setlandlord DCGovernment &lt;region&gt;.</code>
** '''4.3 Set the price'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setprice &lt;price&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code>

<div class="tip">

Let the player know to not buy the region until you tell them to! A lot of people sometimes buy regions too soon, and if that happens you would need to correct how much they’ve paid.


</div>
<span id="expanding-a-region"></span>
===== Expanding a region =====

Lets say a player already has a wild region, but would like to expand it.

* '''1.0 Getting the price for the new region'''
** Select two corners of the new area the player would like their region to be expanded to.
** Note the number of blocks, and multiply it by 10 to get the total cost of the expansion and subtract it by the old region’s price.
* '''2.0 Check if the player can afford it'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/bal &lt;player&gt;</code> - ask if the player is okay with the price.
* '''3.0 Fine the player the cost (after the subtraction)'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/fine &lt;player&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code> - this will open a menu up and the option of <code>Staff</code> should be selected.
* '''4.0 Re-define the region to include BOTH their initial region AND their expanded area'''
** Select the old region via <code>/rg select &lt;region&gt;</code>
** Expand it into the new region with WorldEdit.
** Redefine region into the new size via <code>/rg redefine &lt;region&gt;</code>.

<span id="for-everyone"></span>
== For Everyone ==

<span id="note-taking"></span>
==== Note taking ====

In order to keep comprehensive notes on our players that are easily accessible, we use the discord channel <code>#relations</code>.

Search for the player’s full username, before creating a thread. In these threads we record evidence and general notes about players behaviours and punishments.

<span id="how-and-when-to-action-warrants"></span>
=== How and when to action warrants ===

Warrants are a legal writ that allow for '''only enforcement agencies''' to break the law under certain circumstances. I.e. trespass, take items, gather evidence. This is a function that requires Staff Support.

<div class="tip">

If you are involved in a case/investigation or have a vested interested in the outcome of a case/investigation, you are asked to recuse yourself from getting the information for the warrant.


</div>
<span id="eligibility"></span>
==== Eligibility ====

A warrant is only enforceable if it is has been approved by a Judge or Justice. Agencies seeking to exercise warrants will need to provide proof that the warrant was approved appropriately.

Warrants generally need to be served within a 48 hour window before they expire. - Noting that Staff tickets take more than 48 hours to process these requests, as long as the warrant was posted in a staff ticket prior to the warrant expiring, we can still provide the information post-deadline.

We can search through logs, but excessive requests (i.e. searching multiple days will be denied). - No more than 48 hours and some topics/key words that we can search for within that timeframe is generally seen as acceptable. - Beyond this it is up to the staff member taking the ticket.

<span id="protecting-staff-information"></span>
==== Protecting Staff Information ====

Staff do not have to comply with legal orders - there are no punishments for not providing the information. If something seems off about the request, please raise it with your colleagues or senior staff. It is best to take a more cautious approach rather than accidentally giving away information that shouldn’t be given away.

Warrants need to dictate what information they are seeking. We will usually search for this information and give that information to them only.

<span id="who-can-request-what"></span>
==== Who can request what ====

Animal and Villager Death Logs do not require warrants provided they are being requested by a member of the Department of Justice that is a '''Sergeant or above'''. Everything else requires a warrant!

<span id="everything-senior-vice-presidents-svps"></span>

</div>
Welcome to the DemocracyCraft Staff Guide! This guide contains all staffing policies, tips, and tricks that is used in day-to-day operations. By making this guide public access, our playerbase is informed of the expectations and procedures our Staff are subjected to.

If you are a new hire, first off - congratulations! We’re excited to have you onboard with us. Seeing the table of contents/how long this document is may appear scary at first, but try to remember we don’t expect you to memorise everything. We give you this guide so you know where to refer to when you need help, in addition to your peers.

With enough time, you might end up contributing to this guide!

<span id="staff-wide-policies-1"></span>
== Staff-wide Policies ==

These are policies every Staff member should be familiar with!

<span id="career-progression-and-disciplinary-1"></span>
=== Career Progression and Disciplinary ===

The purpose of this guide is to provide information on how staff are selected and how staff members progress in their careers. This guide also provides guidance on staff-specific disciplinary actions.

<span id="values-2"></span>
==== Values ====

The Staff team operates on four core values

<span id="service-1"></span>
===== Service =====

The selflessness of character to place the interests of our server and its players ahead of your own (Activity, Ticket Counts, etc).

<span id="integrity-1"></span>
===== Integrity =====

The consistency of character to align your thoughts, words, and actions to do what is right (Honesty and Moral Strength).

<span id="respect-1"></span>
===== Respect =====

The humanity of character to value others and treat them with dignity (Engagements).

<span id="excellence-1"></span>
===== Excellence =====

The willingness of character to strive each day to be the best you can be, both in a staff context and personally (Going above and beyond).

<span id="progression-1"></span>
==== Progression ====

Staff progression is determined by a series of factors such as, but not limited to: - Activity - Character - Competence - Suitability for promotion - Engagement with the Server and it’s community - Adherence to Staff Values and Expectations

<span id="what-staff-progression-is-not-determined-by-1"></span>
===== What staff progression is not determined by =====

* Your political or business affiliations, spicy or not.
* Your friendship with other staff members. Your rapport, however, will be considered.
* Whether you simp for, or are politically aligned to, End or Tech.

<span id="who-determines-your-progression-to-these-ranks-1"></span>
===== Who determines your progression to these ranks =====

* '''All''': Your mentor will advise in if and when you are promoted.
* '''Senior Administrator''': Server Leadership
* '''Administrator''': Senior Staff
* '''Moderator''': Administration Team+
* '''Trial Moderator''': Administration Team+

<span id="how-does-it-work-1"></span>
===== How does it work? =====

# A member of the team, generally a senior staff member, will raise a nomination for discussion.
# A discussion is had about the member’s suitability and other defining factors.
# The nomination is put to vote. Generally no comments are provided by the poster of the vote in the vote channel itself in order to maintain neutrality.
# An outcome is reached over time or after further discussion.

<span id="staff-disciplinary-system-1"></span>
=== Staff Disciplinary System ===

If a staff member has been punished under the staff disciplinary system (SDS), they will not be punished under the server rules for the same breach. The staff disciplinary system takes precedence.

<span id="coaching-1"></span>
==== Coaching ====

Coaching is an informal process which is not recorded. Coaching is provided to staff members who make minor mistakes by their staff mentor or other more senior staff members. The aim of coaching is to prevent the behaviour from happening again by discussing what went wrong and how it could be dealt with differently next time.

<span id="warning-1"></span>
==== Warning ====

Warnings are a formal process which is recorded in the Staff member’s channel. Warnings are provided to staff members who continue to repeat behaviours after coaching or who have made errors in judgement. All warnings are tied to a Staff Value(s).

<span id="notice-to-show-cause-ntsc-1"></span>
===== Notice to Show Cause (NTSC) =====

A NTSC is a formal process which is recorded in the Staff member’s channel. A NTSC is provided to staff members who have received an unreasonable amount of warnings, or for continued warnings based on the same behaviours. A NTSC may also be issued to staff who have made significant errors in judgement.

<span id="duties-and-expectations-1"></span>
=== Duties and Expectations ===

Our Staff have several day-to-day roles that are covered under specific titles. Below is a table that comprises of typical duties and who is responsible for each duty.

As you progress up the ranks, you are expected to maintain your prior level’s duties while taking on the added duties. A focus is given to being able to help the server with your extended privilages.

==== Values ====

These are a set of principles that guide us as a team. - '''Service''' - The selflessness of character to place the interests of our server and its players ahead of your own - e.g. activity, ticket counts, etc. - '''Integrity''' - The consistency of character to align your thoughts, words, and actions to do what is right - This refers to being truthful, and your moral strength - '''Respect''' - The humanity of character to value others and treat them with - This refers to how you engage with others - '''Excellence''' - The willingness of character to strive each day to be the best you can be, both in a staff context and personally - This is what is often referred to as ‘going above and beyond’!

<span id="expectations-1"></span>
==== Expectations ====

* As a staff member you have access to certain staff-related information. This should not be shared with anyone outside of the staff team. Respect player confidentiality.
* Be integral. Don’t steal. Don’t lie.
* We all make mistakes and we learn through them. Don’t try and cover them up, it doesn’t help anyone!
* If you aren’t sure, ask your fellow staff members!
* Approach tickets in a timely, friendly, and helpful manner.
* Respect and value the advice of staff that are senior to you.
* Staff permissions are used for tickets while assisting other players only.
* Be positive! - Smile :)

</div>
<span id="for-managers-1"></span>
== For Managers ==

<span id="panel-access-1"></span>
=== Panel Access ===

Managers are responsible for adding Senior Administrators and Administrators to our server control panel. To add a user, follow the steps below. 1. Open the <code>DemocracyCraft</code> server. 2. Navigate to <code>Users</code> and click <code>New User</code>. 3. Enter the Staff member’s email address, and select <code>Manage</code> under <code>Subdomain</code>. This is a temporary permission. 4. You will now notice a new user entry, on the right hand side next to the bin click on <code>Import user permissions</code>. 5. Grab the list of permissions in the next section below, that corresponds to the Staff member’s rank in the team. 6. Paste it in the input box, and click <code>Import</code>. 7. Repeat Steps 2-6 after opening the <code>DemocracyCraft Playground</code> server. 8. Great work! All done. :)

<div class="tip">

Remind the Staff member that all activities are logged, and that we have a mandatory two factor authentication requirement!

<span id="ranks-and-privilages-1"></span>
==== Ranks and Privilages ====

<span id="senior-administrators-1"></span>
===== Senior Administrators =====

<span id="for-senior-administrators-1"></span>
== For Senior Administrators ==

<span id="console-1"></span>
=== Console ===

As a Senior Administrator, you are able to access both the server console and files. To be added to the panel, direct message on Discord either owners to recieve your invitation! You will mainly be using this to configure plugins, fix bugs, and add new features.

<div class="tip">

There is no one set way of learning how to do these things. Trial and error, along with observation goes a great deal in helping you form your own way of doing these things.


</div>
Be sure to log any player-facing changes in #changelog, and any internal changes in #internal-changelog. This way we have an accurate record of who’s done what!

<span id="for-system-administrators-1"></span>
== For System Administrators ==

<span id="resetting-the-nether-and-end-1"></span>
=== Resetting the Nether and End ===

In most instances, a Nether and End reset will occur once every 6 months, typically during our quiet hours. This time frame tends to be 10pm EST - 5am EST is the optimal time for this reset.

<span id="steps-2"></span>
==== Steps ====

# Try to make an announcement in #server-announcements one week away for the desired data.

* Make a follow up announcement at least 48 hours before the reset as well to give players a reminder that this is about to happen!

<span id="how-to-manage-billboards-1"></span>
=== How to manage Billboards ===

We use a plugin called ImageMaps to allow us to implement images in-game via item frames. This plugin is currently how we’re able to make billboards!

<span id="steps-3"></span>
==== Steps ====

# Upload your image to an image hosting service such as [http://imgur.com/ Imgur] or [https://imgbb.com/ ImgBB]
# Download the image in-game by running <code>/imagemap download &lt;filename&gt; &lt;sourceURL&gt;</code>

* Replace <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> with an easy to identify name, without any file extensions such as <code>.png</code>.
* Replace <code>&lt;sourceurl&gt;</code> with a link to the image, this '''should include''' the file extension such as <code>.png</code>.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Place the image in-game by running <code>/imagemap place &lt;filename&gt; [frameInvisible] [frameFixed] [frameGlowing] [size]</code></li></ol>

* Replace <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> with the file name you selected in Step 2. Please add the file extension featured in the <code>&lt;sourceurl&gt;</code> you used earlier.
* Replace <code>[frameInvisible]</code> with “true”, no quotation marks. This ensures that players do not see the default item frame texture in empty spaces of the image.
* Replace <code>[frameFixed]</code> with “true”, no quotation marks. This ensures a clean removal of the image by punching the item frames in creative.
* Replace <code>[frameGlowing]</code> with “false”, no quotation marks. This the frames are not glowing.
* Replace <code>[size]</code> the height (A) and width (A) in the following format: AxB
** i.e. for a 2 by 2 image, it would be: <code>2x2</code>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Admire your work! [[File:/img/staffing/google_imagemap_example.png|Google Logo]]</li></ol>

<span id="understanding-your-forums-privilages-1"></span>
=== Understanding your Forums Privilages ===

As an administrator you have access to our forums control panel. Here you can update user roles and profiles, as well as manage various forum functionality.

You can login to the control panel with the same credentials you use for the forums [https://www.democracycraft.net/admin.php here]

<span id="user-confidentiality-1"></span>
==== User Confidentiality ====

You will have access to more information than a regular player. This information is in confidence and as always, we have a zero tolerance approach to privacy breaches.

<span id="user-role-management-1"></span>
==== User Role Management ====

<div class="warning">

'''Never''' update a user’s primary group. It should always be <code>Registered</code>.


</div>
When updating groups, all you should be modifying are <code>Secondary Groups</code>. Do not modify regular Department or otherwise automated roles.

[[File:/img/staffing/registered_group.png|Registered Primary Group]] Staff changes require two separate roles and one option: <code>Show as Staff</code>, <code>Staff</code>, and <code>Moderator/Administrator/Senior Administrator</code>. [[File:/img/staffing/secondary_group.png|Secondary Groups]]

<span id="broken-role-syncing-1"></span>
==== Broken Role Syncing ====

When a player’s roles are not syncing properly, these are the three simple steps you do to fix this. 1. Remove all their Secondary Group Roles (excluding Staff roles!) 2. Ask them to log in, wait a few seconds and then log out 3. Ask them to log back in after 2-3 seconds

If their roles don’t sync back up - please ask them to log in for 2-3 minutes instead before logging out.

<span id="how-to-conduct-rollbacks-1"></span>
=== How to conduct Rollbacks ===

We use the industry standard plugin CoreProtect to log all of our in-game interactions. This allows us to rollback, inspect, and review any player changes or interactions as they happen.

<span id="commands-5"></span>
==== Commands ====

* <code>/co help</code> - help command; displays all commands.
* <code>/co rb; /co rollback</code> - rollback block data based on certain parameters.
** '''Usage:''' <code>/co rb u:&lt;user&gt; t:&lt;time&gt; r:&lt;radius&gt; a:&lt;action&gt; b:&lt;blocks&gt; e:&lt;exclude&gt;</code>
* <code>/co undo</code> - revert a rollback.

You can see a list of parameters for these commands [[#coreprotect-parameters|here]].

<span id="additional-information-1"></span>
==== Additional Information ====

Here is a [https://youtu.be/JwijCiueZ3Y video tutorial] that goes other aspects of CoreProtect that are not covered within this guide.

<span id="how-to-manage-vpn-bypasses-1"></span>
=== How to manage VPN Bypasses ===

Players will commonly open tickets suffering connection issues. There are multiple ways we can attempt to solve this, but before anything else get them to turn their router off and back on. This is often the simplest solution.

<span id="for-windows-1"></span>
==== '''For Windows''' ====

<span id="flushing-dns-1"></span>
===== Flushing DNS =====

# Navigate to the desktop.
# Right-click the Start button.
# Choose Command Prompt.
# When asked whether to allow Command Prompt to make changes to your computer, select Yes.
# Type <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> and press Enter. You’ll receive a message when your DNS has been cleared.

Flushing the cache removes all the information stored in the cache, forcing the computer to find new DNS information. This will not harm your computer.

<span id="changing-dns-1"></span>
===== Changing DNS =====

# Click on the Start menu, then click on Control Panel.
# Click on Network and Internet.
# Click on Change Adapter Settings.
# Right click on the Wi-Fi network you are connected to, then click Properties.
# Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (or Version 6 if desired).
# Click Properties.
# Write down any existing DNS server entries for future reference.
# Click <code>Use The Following DNS Server Addresses</code>.
# Replace those addresses with the <code>1.1.1.1</code> DNS addresses:
# For '''IPv4''': <code>1.1.1.1</code> and <code>1.0.0.1</code>
# For '''IPv6''': <code>2606:4700:4700::1111</code> and <code>2606:4700:4700::1001</code>
# Click OK, then Close.
# Restart your browser.

<span id="vpn-1"></span>
==== VPN ====

If all fails, this could be a routing issue that cannot be solved through conventional means. Asking the player to use a free Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as [https://cloudflarewarp.com Cloudflare Warp].

If you offer this option, please provide the player with the <code>antivpn.bypass</code> permission node in-game.

<span id="administrative-commands-1"></span>
=== Administrative Commands ===

These are useful commands to know with your position.

<span id="luckperms-1"></span>
==== LuckPerms ====

* <code>/lp; /luckperms; /perm; /perms: /permissions</code> - Main alias. Put these before any LuckPerms command.
* <code>/lp editor [type]</code> - Opens a website interface to edit permissions data. After changes are saved, a command will be given that you need to run for the changes to take effect.
** <code>[type]</code> - the types to include in the editor session. can be <code>all</code>, <code>users</code> or <code>groups</code>.

<span id="user-commands-1"></span>
===== User Commands =====

* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; info</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; permission</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; parent</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; meta</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; editor</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; promote &lt;track&gt; [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; demote &lt;track&gt; [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; showtracks</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; clear [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; clone &lt;user&gt;</code>

<div class="tip">

Add in-game roles via <code>/lp user &lt;user&gt; parent add &lt;job&gt;</code>


</div>
<span id="group-commands-1"></span>
===== Group Commands =====

* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; info</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; permission</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; parent</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; meta</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; editor</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; listmembers [page]</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; setweight &lt;weight&gt;</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; setdisplayname &lt;name&gt;</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; showtracks</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; clear [context...]</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; rename &lt;new name&gt;</code>
* <code>/lp group &lt;group&gt; clone &lt;name of clone&gt;</code>

<span id="general-1"></span>
===== General =====

* <code>/tps</code>- check the ticks-per-second (tps). The go to command to check for server lag. <code>/whois</code> - useful for finding a players IP if you wish to ban their IP.
* <code>/socialspy</code> - able to see players private messages.

<span id="crates-1"></span>
===== Crates =====

* <code>/crates give &lt;user&gt; &lt;crate&gt;</code> - sometimes it’s easier to give these to yourself and then transfer them to the player’s inventory. This is for a couple of reasons:
** It won’t work if the player’s inventory is full.
** It requires the player to be online.

<span id="for-moderators-1"></span>
== For Moderators ==

Here is everything a Moderator needs to know!

<span id="managing-players-1"></span>
=== Managing Players ===

Players are tricky business but shouldn’t be feared - after all you are one! Here are some guides on scenarios and managing behaviour.

<span id="how-to-check-for-alternative-accounts-1"></span>
==== How to check for Alternative Accounts ====

Players are only allowed one account on our discord, forums, and in-game. This is for a few reasons; mainly for ease of identification and punishment as well as for economic reasons in game.

Players who join and show as alternative accounts should be alternative accounts tested.

<div class="info">

Players who have alternative accounts will receive all of the punishments associated on their main account. The alternative accounts should be banned.


</div>
<span id="assessing-1"></span>
===== Assessing =====

When someone first joins the server, our punishments plugin automatically runs a check on them (manually you can do <code>/alts &lt;username&gt;</code>). This scans their account to see if there are any other accounts that are playing on the same IP as them.

<div class="figure">

[[File:/img/staffing/flagged_alt_account_examples.png|Alternative Accounts Flagged Example]]

</div>
Once you do <code>/alts</code>, something like this will come up. If there are two or more green usernames (which means that they are both online at the same time), check <code>#relations</code> on discord to see if someone has already done an alternative accounts test on them. If no one has, then you need to conduct one.

If you run <code>/alts</code> on someone and they have one green username and one or more grey usernames, that means that an account with the same IP has logged on before. Check <code>#relations</code> to see if they have passed the alternative accounts test before. If they haven’t, make a note in <code>#relations</code>.

You can also check both accounts’ command histories by running <code>/co lookup</code> on them. If one account has transferred all of its money to the other account, it is pretty safe to say that they are alternative accounts.

<span id="testing-1"></span>
===== Testing =====

If both accounts are online you can first try conducting the movement test.

# You can warp yourself and them to the alts testing area using <code>/warp alts &lt;player&gt;</code>.
# Once both players are there, inform them that their accounts have been flagged as suspicious and that you need to conduct an alternative accounts test on them.
# Ask one player to run on the pink line and the other on the blue line.
# You then look to verify that both accounts are making independent movements from one another (they are both moving at the same time).

If they fail the test in one of these listed ways, you’re allowed to ban one of the accounts permanently for having alt accounts; 1. One of the players is not moving or moving every so often 2. Only one player moves at a time 3. One is uncooperative with the test (not responding to anything) 4. One or both accounts log off and do not return after a while.

However, if the players pass, you can run <code>/staff-notanalt &lt;username 1&gt; &lt;username 2&gt;</code> and it will remove the warning and add a message in <code>#notes</code>.

Additionally, you could go into <code>/spectator</code> and <code>/staff-tp</code> to them to further investigate/watch their movements to verify that they aren’t alts.

<span id="worldedit-1"></span>
==== WorldEdit ====

We use WorldEdit as a tool for many staff duties and staff duties only. Seen staff members rolling around with a wooden axe? Yep, that’s a WorldEdit wand.

We use WorldEdit to make selections for regioning, vaulting, and assisting players in most instances, Abuse of this plugin is strictly not tolerated. You can find a practical course on the Staff Training warp to help with this guide.

It may seem like a lot to learn at first, however it’s quite straight forward after a bit of time and experience.

<span id="getting-started-1"></span>
===== Getting Started =====

<span id="making-a-selection-1"></span>
====== Making a selection ======

A cuboid is like 3D rectangle. In WorldEdit, you select the region that you want by setting two points of a cuboid. In the next example, the first point is the top right corner of the cuboid and the second point is the bottom left corner of the cuboid.

<div class="figure">

[[File:https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/_images/cuboid.png|World Edit Cuboid Visualization]]

</div>
<span id="how-do-you-choose-the-two-points-you-can-1"></span>
====== How do you choose the two points? You can… ======

* Left and right click blocks while holding a wooden axe (use <code>//wand</code> to get a wooden axe)
* Stand somewhere and enter <code>//pos1</code> and <code>//pos2</code>
* Look at a block and enter <code>//hpos1</code> and <code>//hpos2</code>

<span id="commands-6"></span>
===== Commands =====

* <code>//wand</code> - gives you a World Edit tool.Left click a block while holding it to make your first selectionRight click a block while holding it to make your second selection
* <code>//wandoff</code> - takes away a World Edit tool from your inventory.
* <code>//cut</code> - copies and clears your current selection.
* <code>//paste</code> - pastes your previous cut selection.
* <code>//expand &lt;amount&gt; [direction]</code> - makes your current selection expand by the amount specified in the specified direction.
** Amount is either specfified as a number or <code>vert</code> (infinitely vertical).
* <code>//calc</code> - short for ‘calculate’. Allows you to do equations in-game. Example: <code>//calc 100*7</code>
* <code>//sel [poly/cuboid]</code> - select the type of region.
** <code>Cuboid</code> is the '''default''' selection type; basic two point selection
** Left click a block to set first selection
** Right click a block to set a second selection.
** Poly is the '''advanced''' selection type.
** Left click a block to set first selection
** Right click a block to set a second, third, fourth, etc. selection
* <code>//sel</code> - when used like this this command will clear your current selection.
* <code>//rotate &lt;degrees&gt;</code> - rotates your current clipboard (cut/copy) the specified degrees.
** Degrees have to be in multiples of 90 or it won’t work.
** i.e. <code>90</code>, <code>180</code>, <code>270</code>, <code>360</code>, <code>-90</code>, <code>-180</code>, <code>-270</code>, <code>-360</code>.
* <code>//move &lt;amount of blocks&gt; [direction]</code> - moves your current selection by the amount specified in the specified direction.
* <code>/expand &lt;number&gt; [direction]</code> - modifies your selection in the direction specified by the amount of blocks specific.

<span id="directions-can-be-1"></span>
====== Directions can be… ======

* '''Relative to the world'''
** i.e. <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>north</code>, <code>east</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>west</code>.
* '''Relative to the player'''
** i.e. <code>forward</code>, <code>back</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code>.

If a direction is ommited from the command, the region will expand in the direction the player is looking.

'''Examples:''' - <code>//expand 6</code> - Expand 6 blocks in the direction you’re facing - <code>//expand 10 up</code> - Expand 10 blocks upwards - <code>//expand vert</code> - Expand the region selection from bedrock to the sky. Do '''not''' use when making rentable regions (i.e. apartment rooms)

<span id="areashop-1"></span>
==== AreaShop ====

AreaShop is essentially a real estate plugin for world guard regions, allowing us to sell and rent them. You’re now able to sell and unrent regions owned by other players - This is used for when evicting players from a region.

This is a general guide - moderators should refer to the more specific guides on regioning.

[[#urban-regioning|Learn more about Apartments/Shops regioning]]

[[#wild-regioning|Learn more about Wilderness regioning]]

<span id="commands-7"></span>
===== Commands =====

* <code>/as add &lt;buy/sell&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code> - makes a region either a buyable or rentable region.
** Used when making wilderness or apartment/shop regions.

<div class="warning">

You must specify the shop/apartment’s region name when maing it rentable, otherwise you run the risk of making the parent plot rentable instead!


</div>
* <code>/as del &lt;region&gt;</code> - deletes the specified region from AreaShop.
* <code>/as setprice &lt;price&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code> - used to set the selling/renting price of an AreaShop region.

<span id="how-tos-1"></span>
=== How-tos ===

<span id="managing-disputes-1"></span>
==== Managing disputes ====

As a staff member you will sometimes be required to handle delicate situations. We run on a few principles to assist staff making decisions in these scenarios.

<span id="solve-problems-as-early-as-possible-at-the-lowest-level-1"></span>
===== Solve problems as early as possible at the lowest level =====

Unfortunately arguments and disputes are not like wine and don’t get better over time. They get worse.

It’s really important for all parties that we jump on any situation early and solve the problem pacifically.

<span id="steer-clear-of-drama-1"></span>
===== Steer clear of drama =====

Some players have a tendency to incite drama and you will come to learn who they are quite quickly. Be compassionate but keep a mind on players’ motives.

Usually, what happens out of the server and its’ server related channels isn’t for us to deal with unless it’s quite serious and relates to our platforms. i.e. bullying enabled by our Discord server.

<span id="evidence-1"></span>
===== Evidence =====

Sometimes players can get a little invested or tell white lies (i.e. not telling you the whole story where they may have also been at fault) when presenting to you with a report.

Make sure you collect evidence to support claims, regardless of the amount of people wanting a player banned for example.

<span id="there-are-two-sides-to-every-story-1"></span>
===== There are two sides to every story =====

There will always be a personal bias in every story. Person A’s story will always be slightly different from Person B’s story.

It’s important that you assess both sides to come up with an educated guestimate of the truth which is usually somewhere between the two stories.

<span id="searching-for-items-1"></span>
==== Searching for Items ====

We use Coreprotect to log all of block interactions. This allows us to lookup certain interactions.

<span id="commands-8"></span>
===== Commands =====

* <code>/co l; /co lookup</code> - used to lookup specific block data.
* <code>/co l u:&lt;user&gt; t:&lt;time&gt; r:&lt;radius&gt; a:&lt;action&gt; b:&lt;blocks&gt; e:&lt;exclude&gt;</code>

<span id="parameters-1"></span>
=== <a id="coreprotect-parameters"></a>Parameters ===

These can be used in almost every CoreProtect command.

<span id="uuser-1"></span>
==== <code>u:&lt;user&gt;</code> ====

* Specify a user to rollback. Example: u:Technofied

<span id="ttime-1"></span>
==== <code>t:&lt;time&gt;</code> ====

Specify the amount of time to rollback. You can specify weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

'''Example:''' t:2w,5d,7h,2m,10s

You can pick and choose time amounts. '''Example:''' t:5d2h

You can also use decimals '''Example:''' t:2.50h (2 and a half hours)

<span id="rradius-1"></span>
==== <code>r:&lt;radius&gt;</code> ====

Specify a radius. You can use this to only rollback blocks near you.

You can specify a number (i.e. <code>r:5</code>), a world (i.e. <code>r:#world_the_end</code>), a global rollback (<code>r:#global</code>), or a WorldEdit selection (<code>r:#worldedit</code> or <code>r:#we</code>)

For example, the following would only rollback damage within 10 blocks of where you are standing: <code>r:10</code>

<span id="aaction-1"></span>
==== <code>a:&lt;action&gt;</code> ====

Restrict the rollback to a certain action.

'''Example:''' If you wanted to only rollback blocks placed, you would use <code>a:+block</code>.

'''Here’s a list of all the actions:''' - <code>a:block</code> - blocks placed/broken - <code>a:+block</code> - blocks placed - <code>a:-block</code> - blocks broken - <code>a:chat</code> - messages sent in chat - <code>a:click</code> - player interactions - <code>a:command</code> - commands used - <code>a:container</code> - items taken from or put in chests - <code>a:+container</code> - items put in chests - <code>a:-container</code> - items taken from chests - <code>a:inventory</code> - items dropped or picked up by players - <code>a:+inventory</code> - items picked up by players - <code>a:-inventory</code> - items dropped by players - <code>a:item</code> - items dropped, picked up, taken from, or put in chests - <code>a:+item</code> - items picked up or put in chests - <code>a:-item</code> - items dropped or taken from chests - <code>a:kill</code> - mobs/animals killed - <code>a:session</code> - player logins/logouts - <code>a:+session</code> - player logins - <code>a:-session</code> - player logouts - <code>a:sign</code> - messages written on signs - <code>a:username</code> - username changes

<span id="bblocks-1"></span>
==== <code>b:&lt;blocks&gt;</code> ====

Restrict the rollback to certain block types. For example, if you wanted to only rollback stone, you would use b:1 You can specify multiple items, such as b:1,5,7

<span id="eexclude---exclude-certain-block-types-from-the-rollback.-1"></span>
==== <code>e:&lt;exclude&gt;</code> - Exclude certain block types from the rollback. ====

'''Example:''' If you don’t want TNT to come back during a rollback, you would type e:46

<span id="hashtag---add-a-hashtag-to-the-end-of-your-command-to-perform-additional-actions.-1"></span>
==== <code>#&lt;hashtag&gt;</code> - Add a hashtag to the end of your command to perform additional actions. ====

'''Example:''' To perform a rollback preview, you would use <code>#preview</code>

'''Here’s a list of available hashtags:''' - <code>#preview</code> - preview a rollback/restore - <code>#verbose</code> - display additional information during a rollback/restore - <code>#silent</code> - display minimal information during a rollback/restore

<span id="merging-regions-1"></span>
==== Merging regions ====

Players may merge certain regions to allow for larger plots, provided that they own two or more neighbouring regions.

A common Sistake in staffing is regions being deleted during merges.

<div class="danger">

To merge a plot correctly, no regions should be deleted, both to save us time when unmerging and to preserve the plot numbering system.


</div>
To achieve this the following command ought to be used <code>/rg redefine &lt;plot&gt;</code>

<span id="merging-1"></span>
===== Merging =====

To merge a region is quite simple - all that is required is to redefine a region over the plot divider. See below for an example.

<div class="figure">

[[File:/img/staffing/merge_regions_example.png|Merging Example Image]]

</div>
<span id="what-can-be-merged-1"></span>
===== What can be merged? =====

You can merge any commercial and industrial plots.

Residential, CBD, and any other special plots are '''NOT''' to be merged.

<span id="urban-regioning-1"></span>
==== <a id="urban-regioning"></a> Urban Regioning ====

Urban regions are city/town plots and their child regions (apartments/shops).

This guide will show you how to create child regions. For this, you will be using World Edit (selecting the region), World Guard (making the region), and Areashop (renting the region).

<div class="danger">

* Child regions may only be created on Commercial and Industrial plots, not residential and are rent only. You '''cannot''' have rent regions within rent regions.


</div>
<span id="step-by-step-guide-2"></span>
===== Step by Step Guide =====

* '''1.1 Creating the WorldGuard region and fining the player.'''
** After selecting the points for the region you can define the region to create it.
** The owner of the building may choose the name of the region.
** '''Command:''' <code>/rg define &lt;regionName&gt;</code>.
*** i.e. <code>/rg define EndStore1</code>.
* '''1.2 Make sure to fine the player for the creation of each region.'''
** Each region costs $25 to create excluding shulker regions, those are free.
** '''Command:''' <code>/fine &lt;user&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code>.
*** Select “Staff” as the account to send the fine to.
*** i.e. <code>/fine xEndeavour 25</code>.
* '''2.0 Setting the region parent.'''
** Next we need to tell WorldGuard who the child region belongs to. In order to do this, we will parent the child region to the plot it’s on.
** The parent is the plot the room will inherit permissions from.
** Setting the room’s parent will allow the plot owner and any other members of the plot to modify within the rooms.
** '''Command:''' <code>/rg parent &lt;regionName&gt; &lt;PlotRegion&gt;</code>.
*** i.e. <code>/rg parent EndStore1 c001</code>.
* '''3.0 Adding the region to AreaShop'''
* After you have created the WorldGuard region and parented it, it’s now time to make it rentable. All you need to do is add the region to Areashop.
** '''Command:''' <code>/as add rent &lt;regionName&gt;.</code>
* '''3.1 Set the landlord'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setlandlord &lt;landlord&gt; &lt;regionName&gt;</code>, this usually is the player who is creating the region.
* '''3.2 Set the price'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setprice &lt;price&gt; &lt;regionName&gt;</code>
* '''3.3 Set the duration'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setduration &lt;duration&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code>
* '''4.0 Adding an AreaShop sign'''
** If the player is unable to provide a sign for you to place and create, you can obtain one by using <code>/staff-getsign</code>.
** After you get a sign, you can place it somewhere outside of the door/front of the region where any player can access.
** The player will usually show you where they want the signs.
** After the sign is placed look at it and use the command: <code>/as setsign &lt;regionName&gt;</code>, this will make the sign interactive and add the region’s information to it.
* '''5.0 Quality Checks'''

Check the priority of the region is 30 or above via <code>/rg info &lt;regionName&gt;</code> - if not click on the priority and type in 30.

Make sure to get rid of the wool that you placed, don’t leave anything behind.

<span id="using-the-sign-based-method-1"></span>
===== Using the sign-based method =====

If you prefer doing region creation through signs, try [https://github.com/NLthijs48/AreaShop/wiki/Basic-regions-setup#rental-region this]!

<span id="wild-regioning-1"></span>
==== <a id="wild-regioning"></a> Wild Regioning ====

Wilderness regions are private wild plots that any players can obtain.

It costs $10/block to claim land in the wilderness.

:::danger Please note the following: - Players may only have '''one''' wild region up to '''4096 blocks''' in their wild region, and unless given permission, your region needs to be at least 20 blocks away from another player’s region.

:::

<span id="step-by-step-guide-3"></span>
===== Step By Step Guide =====

* '''1.0 Getting the price for the region'''
** To get the price, you’re going to use your wand to select two corners but make sure they are on the same height (y level).
** This will give you the total number of blocks within your selection
** After this, multiply the total block number by 10 to get the price.
** '''Command:'''<code>//calc &lt;totalblocks&gt;*10</code>

<div class="figure">

[[File:/img/staffing/wild_price_calculation_example.png|Wild region price calculation example]]

</div>
* '''2.0 Seeing if the player can afford it'''
** After getting the total price of the land, check the player’s balance to see if they can afford it.
** Command: <code>/bal &lt;player&gt;</code>
** '''If they have enough money''', tell them the price and ask if it’s okay.
** '''If they don’t have enough money''', let them know, maybe they’ll have money in their companies. Otherwise, offer to resize the selection.
* '''3.0 Creating the WorldGuard region'''
** Now that we have the region selected and we know the player can afford it, it’s time to define the region.
** '''Command:''' <code>/rg define &lt;playerName&gt;</code>
*** i.e. <code>/rg define Technofied</code>

<div class="danger">

All wild regions should have the same naming convention: <code>&lt;playerName&gt;</code>


</div>
* '''4.0 Adding the region to AreaShop'''
** After you’ve created the WorldGuard region, it’s now time to make it buyable.
** '''4.1 Add the region'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as add buy &lt;regionName&gt;</code>
** '''4.2 Set the landlord'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setlandlord DCGovernment &lt;region&gt;.</code>
** '''4.3 Set the price'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/as setprice &lt;price&gt; &lt;region&gt;</code>

<div class="tip">

Let the player know to not buy the region until you tell them to! A lot of people sometimes buy regions too soon, and if that happens you would need to correct how much they’ve paid.


</div>
<span id="expanding-a-region-1"></span>
===== Expanding a region =====

Lets say a player already has a wild region, but would like to expand it.

* '''1.0 Getting the price for the new region'''
** Select two corners of the new area the player would like their region to be expanded to.
** Note the number of blocks, and multiply it by 10 to get the total cost of the expansion and subtract it by the old region’s price.
* '''2.0 Check if the player can afford it'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/bal &lt;player&gt;</code> - ask if the player is okay with the price.
* '''3.0 Fine the player the cost (after the subtraction)'''
** '''Command:''' <code>/fine &lt;player&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</code> - this will open a menu up and the option of <code>Staff</code> should be selected.
* '''4.0 Re-define the region to include BOTH their initial region AND their expanded area'''
** Select the old region via <code>/rg select &lt;region&gt;</code>
** Expand it into the new region with WorldEdit.
** Redefine region into the new size via <code>/rg redefine &lt;region&gt;</code>.

<span id="for-everyone-1"></span>
== For Everyone ==

<span id="note-taking-1"></span>
==== Note taking ====

In order to keep comprehensive notes on our players that are easily accessible, we use the discord channel <code>#relations</code>.

Search for the player’s full username, before creating a thread. In these threads we record evidence and general notes about players behaviours and punishments.

<span id="how-and-when-to-action-warrants-1"></span>
=== How and when to action warrants ===

Warrants are a legal writ that allow for '''only enforcement agencies''' to break the law under certain circumstances. I.e. trespass, take items, gather evidence. This is a function that requires Staff Support.

<div class="tip">

If you are involved in a case/investigation or have a vested interested in the outcome of a case/investigation, you are asked to recuse yourself from getting the information for the warrant.


</div>
<span id="eligibility-1"></span>
==== Eligibility ====

A warrant is only enforceable if it is has been approved by a Judge or Justice. Agencies seeking to exercise warrants will need to provide proof that the warrant was approved appropriately.

Warrants generally need to be served within a 48 hour window before they expire. - Noting that Staff tickets take more than 48 hours to process these requests, as long as the warrant was posted in a staff ticket prior to the warrant expiring, we can still provide the information post-deadline.

We can search through logs, but excessive requests (i.e. searching multiple days will be denied). - No more than 48 hours and some topics/key words that we can search for within that timeframe is generally seen as acceptable. - Beyond this it is up to the staff member taking the ticket.

<span id="protecting-staff-information-1"></span>
==== Protecting Staff Information ====

Staff do not have to comply with legal orders - there are no punishments for not providing the information. If something seems off about the request, please raise it with your colleagues or senior staff. It is best to take a more cautious approach rather than accidentally giving away information that shouldn’t be given away.

Warrants need to dictate what information they are seeking. We will usually search for this information and give that information to them only.

<span id="who-can-request-what-1"></span>
==== Who can request what ====

Animal and Villager Death Logs do not require warrants provided they are being requested by a member of the Department of Justice that is a '''Sergeant or above'''. Everything else requires a warrant!

<span id="everything-senior-vice-presidents-svps-1"></span>

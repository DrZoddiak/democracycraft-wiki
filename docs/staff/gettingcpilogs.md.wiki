=== Step 2: Collecting that month’s data ===

Once you download the logs, open them. Notepad works great.

Next, '''find''' the month you’re looking for by doing '''yyyy/mm/01'''. Find on Windows is ctrl+f; Find on Mac is cmd+f.

</div>
Now you’ll select all of that month’s bar. This is a lot. (Tip: put an extra space or two between the start of the month and end of the month for a more distinct start and end.)

Select all of the month’s transactions. You can click and drag, or put your cursor at the very start of the month, move down to the end, hold shift, and click the very end and it will highlight everything inbetween. (Tip: do this in sections.)

Once you’ve selected all of the month you’d like, copy and paste it into it’s own document. (Windows: ctrl+c / ctrl+v ; Mac: cmd+c / cmd+v)

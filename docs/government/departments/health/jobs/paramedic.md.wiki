<span id="protocols"></span>
== Protocols ==

* Be patient when communicating with players. Keep calm and empathetic.
* Honesty is the best policy. If you make a mistake, own up to it.
* Paramedics are doctors as well. Do not ignore doctor duties (attending patients in the hospital), as this may lead to termination.
* Be mindful of fellow EMTs. Do not take all the supplies in the EMT room for yourself.
* Do not use your ambulance for personal reasons. Keep it stocked with pharmaceuticals and within easy reach.
* Obey all traffic laws. You must drive carefully and park appropriately.
* Never abuse Paramedic commands in any way.
* Never purposefully drive the patient to a location other than the intended hospital/clinic.
* Communicate with fellow EMTs and other department members. Ask for help when you need it.
* The Secretary reserves the right to dismiss poorly performing members of the department.

Doctor protocols and rules apply. Please check out the [https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/doctor-guide.1450/ Doctor Guide].

<span id="rules"></span>
== RULES ==

* Paramedics should not lose their issued ambulance. Losing it will result in a fine equivalent to the price of the vehicle.
* Paramedics can store Leg Splints, Bandages, and Soothing Potions in the trunk of their ambulance to treat patients on-site.
** They may also attend government or server events to handle emergencies there.
* Paramedics cannot use their ambulance for personal usage. Doing so will result in a warning the first time.
** Doing so the second time will result in your Paramedic license + vehicle being revoked.
* If the patient does not have a contagious disease (such as Broken Legs or a Wound), you may treat them on location.
** Never hand out free treatments.

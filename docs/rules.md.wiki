[[File:/img/rules/Rules_and_Laws_Enforcement.png|Rules and Laws - Who enforces what?]] [[File:/img/rules/Bystanders.png|Rules and Laws - Let’s avoid Bystanders]]

Moderation is an important aspect of keeping our server a welcome and inclusive environment for everyone to enjoy. Below, we’ve included some guidelines that apply on all DemocracyCraft platforms.

Staff maintain full discretion in their enforcement of rules and general moderation.

Feel free to ask questions on [https://discord.gg/democracy our Discord server] if you have any questions or concerns.

{{Tip||| Respect the spirit of the rules These rules are here to protect you - not for us to come after you!

You will never be punished for raising a concern regading rules, regardless of whether it is about yourself or others.

Something may not be explicitly defined here, that doesn’t necessary make it ok. If you have to consider whether it is allowed, ask!}}

## Duties

As a Guide, your duties include:
- Initiating tours with new players using the ``/doe-guideattend username`` command.
- Attending at least 2 tours per week.
- Using guiding questions to build relationships with new players.
- Following a specific route to introduce players to various server locations and topics.
- Reporting harassment or disruptions during tours.
- Utilizing the Tour Protection act to maintain a safe and informative tour experience.
- Requesting evaluations for promotion after 7 days as a Trainee Guide.

## Structure

The Department of Education's structure includes:
- Tour Guides: You, as the front-line guides responsible for welcoming and informing new players.
- Tour Managers: Your mentors who provide support and training.
  
## Attending

Use guiding questions as conversation starters to help build relationships. To initiate a tour with a new player, Tour Guides use an attend system.

Run the command `/doe-guideattend ``username``.

Remember, you must attend at least 2 tours per week.

## Guiding Questions

Begin by introducing yourself and your role. Then, choose from a variety of questions to ask, such as:

1. How are you?
2. How long have you been playing Minecraft?
3. Have you joined any other city servers or is this your first?
4. How did you find DemocracyCraft?
5. Is there a particular aspect of the server that has piqued your interest?

If not, explain the different aspects of DemocracyCraft and encourage them to use the tutorial. Emphasize the government aspect, as it is a major draw for many players.

Don't forget to ask if they have any questions or concerns about being a new player here.

## Route

As a Tour Guide, follow a specific route and discuss the listed topics:

**Locations:**

1. Spawn - ``/spawn``, ``/warps``, towns
2. Capitol - Basic government explanation (keep it simple)
3. Billboards/bus - Transport, current billboards
4. Government Building - Post office, government shop, residential exam
5. Police Station - Police, ``/laws``, ``/rules``, guns
6. Rentable Stalls - Starting a business, renting, apartments
7. Train station - Another transport option
8. Hospital - Doctor exams, ``/health``
9. TP to /university - Show them how to get a job

If you experience harassment from guidees, report it to the staff. You may end a tour and communication with your guidee if you feel uncomfortable.

## Tour Protection

Utilize the Tour Protection act if another player disrupts your tour.

Disrupting a Tour is a summary criminal offense, with a verbal warning for the first offense per tour and a $500 fine and 15 minutes jail time for subsequent offenses.

Note that this charge can be applied in addition to the Murder charge per offense if the Tour Guide is killed.

A tour begins with ``/doe-attend`` and ends at the final tour stop or if a player/guide willingly leaves the tour.

## Evaluation

After 7 days on the job, Trainee Guides may request an evaluation for promotion. Speak to your mentor (the Tour Manager who trained you) to proceed.

## Conclusion

As a Tour Guide, your role is vital in making new players feel welcomed and engaged in DemocracyCraft. By building relationships, providing valuable information, and offering support, you contribute significantly to the growth and success of the community. Always strive to improve your skills, stay up-to-date with server changes, and maintain a positive attitude. Your efforts in guiding new players will not only enhance their experience but also help shape the future of DemocracyCraft.

Remember, your mentor and the Department of Education are here to support you throughout your journey as a Tour Guide. Good luck, and enjoy making a lasting impact on new players' experiences!

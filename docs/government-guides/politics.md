DemocracyCraft is the server where players make and amend the rules and laws that govern them. Whether you're a seasoned politician or a budding statesperson, this guide is designed to help those who want to change our nation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose you path
- **Local Government.** Start your career in the town councils. Work your way to Mayorship and make a big impact in a small place!
- **Federal Government.** Start your career in the Federal arena. Run for Congress, work your way up through Departments, or run for the Presidency! 
- **Political Powerbroker.** Join a political party or lobby group and change the nation through persuasion and compromise.

### 2. Understand the Government
Explore the existing political structure. Understand the roles of elected officials, the legislative process, and the power dynamics within the government. Seek first to understand, then seek to be understood.

### 3. Elections and Campaigning
- **Running for Office.** Declare your candidacy for various positions. Craft a compelling platform and engage with voters to secure their support.
- **Vote Wisely.** As a citizen, make informed decisions during elections. Evaluate candidates based on their platforms and past performance.
- **Joining a Political Party.** To jumpstart your political journey in Redmont, consider joining an existing party. Visit the DemocracyCraft discord and research political parties in the parties forum channel to assist you with campaigning! 
- **Create a Political Party.** Can't find a political party that best represents your values? Create one yourself or run independent!
 
### 4. Legislation and Governance
- **Propose Laws.** As a politician, actively contribute by proposing legislation. Address the needs of the community and strive for positive change.
- **Participate in Debates.** Engage in debates to discuss policies, share your vision, and influence public opinion.

## Elected Positions

In Redmont, various elected positions are available for individuals to pursue, including:

- **President.** As the highest-ranking official in the executive branch, the President oversees the branch's operation and plays a significant role in policy-making. Due to the position's responsibilities, stringent requirements must be met: candidates must have joined the server more than four months ago and have at least 300 hours of playtime. Presidential terms last four months.

- **Senator.** Serving as one of the two legislative branches, the Senate functions as a review board for legislation passed in the House of Representatives. Senators cannot draft legislation but evaluate judicial and executive nominations. Senators serve four-month terms, and candidates must have a minimum of 72 hours of playtime.

- **Representative.** The House of Representatives, the second legislative branch, is where bills originate and are crafted. Representatives serve two-month terms, and candidates must have at least 24 hours of playtime.

- **Local Councils.** Town positions are managed independently. Reach out to town mayors or check Discord channels for details. Local roles offer a great entry point for aspiring public servants.
